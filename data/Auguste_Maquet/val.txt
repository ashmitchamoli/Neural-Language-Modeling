One day as I was setting off on an expedition , ‘ Go , ’ said she ; ‘ at your return I will give you a surprise. ’ I questioned her , but in vain ; she would tell me nothing , and I departed .
The king went away enchanted .
Besides , D ’ Artagnan has not told us his idea yet. ” And the Musketeer , with his usual coolness , reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast .
Each retired to his own apartment .
I might have suspected he was poisoning us. ” “ And you see you would have been deceived. ” “ Yes , doubtless. ” “ But believe me , that man has other projects .
Was there nothing to fear ?
save me !
I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice , and that is , that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year , during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money .
You have brought me something ? ” “ Yes , if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief. ” “ Here it is , ” said Aramis , taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl , “ here it is .
“ Ah , ” said he , “ you have remarked— ” “ I must have been blind not to have seen. ” “ Yes , ” said Porthos , “ that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband , and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church , buried in this vile quarter , solely for the sake of seeing me. ” “ Monsieur Porthos , ” said the procurator ’ s wife , “ will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes ?
He ran along the high road , took the path he had before taken , and reaching the ferry , interrogated the boatman .
Impossible ! ” The conversation had rested there and Scarron , through sheer obstinacy , had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently .
“ I give you his very words ; and if the marquis chooses to be candid , he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him , when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter. ” 0091m “ That is true , ” answered the marquis .
“ Is the spot far from here ? ” “ A hundred leagues. ” “ It is not ill-planned , ” said the governor .
To prison with him !
“ Well , Laporte ? ” asked the queen .
That instant the arm of Porthos fell .
some one ! ” La Ramee ran in haste to obey the call .
My God , grant that he may one day suffer what I suffer ! ” “ Upon the Gospel , ” said D ’ Artagnan , throwing himself down by the dying man , “ I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to drink of it as you did. ” “ I do not believe you , ” cried the soldier , and he expired amid horrible tortures .
Have you been working all night ?
With your lasso you could stop an ox ? ” Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture .
Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love , which had your mother ’ s sanction .
The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again , but controlling himself he answered : “ Port wine. ” “ Ah !
Barrois , his features convulsed , his eyes suffused with blood , and his head thrown back , was lying at full length , beating the floor with his hands , while his legs had become so stiff , that they looked as if they would break rather than bend .
A hundred thousand francs for a fowl ! ” “ Ah , excellency , you can not imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves ! ” “ Come , come , this is very droll—very amusing—I allow ; but , as I am very hungry , pray allow me to eat .
“ Very good , ” said the prince , understanding the reason of that ignorance ; “ the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery ; he might have purchased his life by speaking ; he doesn ’ t wish to speak .
His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel , who began his story with trembling .
Bonacieux , with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable .
Is it large ? ” “ Middling. ” “ How is it arranged ? ” “ Faith , I should require pen , ink , and paper to make a plan. ” “ They are all here , ” said Caderousse , briskly .
“ One thing only puzzles me , namely , how Franz d ’ Épinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife .
Help ! ” “ Sir , ” said Comminges , “ declare yourself at once ; will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king ? ” “ I obey , I obey , sir ! ” cried Broussel , trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son , who seemed determined to dispute authority .
“ This was , indeed , a horrid event , ” said he in a hoarse voice .
“ ‘ Yes , it is very annoying , ’ said Vampa ; ‘ but we have not seen him. ’ “ Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions , but in vain ; then , after a time , they disappeared .
As to getting him drunk , the duke couldn ’ t hope to do that , and he laughed at the mere thought of it .
Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye ; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition .
“ On your brow I read despair—your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings—your hands tremble .
“ What ?
The plan adopted by D ’ Artagnan was soon perfected .
Athos forced his way through and entered , followed by the young man .
“ Now , ” said the baron , “ look at this woman .
“ What are you saying to her ? ” said Morcerf in an undertone .
Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped ? ” “ More reason , then , when he spoke to you , for sending him about his business. ” “ A quarrel ? ” asked Athos .
it would not be long before I should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in France than the Cardinal Mazarin ! ” At this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile ; and had they not known it for a fact , this would have told them that De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there .
a fearful day , when to-day we find our friends ? ” “ Yes ; but under what circumstances ? ” “ ’ Tis true that our position is an awkward one ; but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done. ” “ Things look black enough , ” replied Porthos ; “ I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt. ” “ Silence ! ” cried the Gascon ; “ do not utter that name. ” “ But , ” argued Porthos , “ I speak French and they are all English. ” D ’ Artagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity .
To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which , if successful , would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty , sixty , perhaps a hundred feet , at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks , should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels ; and even , supposing all these perils past , then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme , resigning himself rather to death .
“ Halt ! ” he cried , “ this time we shall be pursued .
The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests ; it is a long rectangle , divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners .
Repair your crimes toward her ; let her go free , and I will exact nothing else from you. ” “ You will exact ! ” said Buckingham , looking at Felton with astonishment , and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them .
“ Say , rather , crime ! ” replied the doctor .
It was said that she had poisoned her second husband ; she had tried to assassinate her brother-in-law ; she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival , and before leaving England she had , it was believed , caused the favorite of the king to be murdered. ” “ Buckingham ? ” cried the monk .
Did you not observe his despair on the journey ?
“ Oh , their heads are soon cut off , ” said Danglars .
It is done , ” cried she , wiping away her tears , and resuming her firmness , “ I am resolved not to die of remorse , but rather of shame .
His majesty , I can assure you , will be tried on his arrival in London ; I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to expect. ” A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis .
“ As for the ink , ” said Faria , “ I told you how I managed to obtain that—and I only just make it from time to time , as I require it. ” “ One thing still puzzles me , ” observed Dantès , “ and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight ? ” “ I worked at night also , ” replied Faria .
oh ! ” he said , “ I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of Orleans .
I neither reproach you nor hate you , my friend .
The count had , moreover , charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the Argentina .
“ It is really wonderful , ” said the count ; “ above all , if , as I suppose , it is payable at sight. ” “ It is , indeed , ” said Danglars .
You shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it , or I will throw it into the Seine ; and I doubt , as was the case with Polycrates , whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us. ” “ Well , I will take it , then , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
Do you know her ? ” Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid .
In fact , at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St .
Short and stout. ” “ Who is it ? ” they all asked together in a low tone .
At eight o ’ clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled , and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition .
The siege once over , we shall be able to make a tour in that direction. ” “ And that will not be long , it is to be hoped , ” said Porthos ; “ for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes .
It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife , he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere .
Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death , the Piazza del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry .
“ The great man has called me his friend ! ” “ Yes , my friend , yes , ” said the cardinal , with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume , but which deceived none who knew him ; “ and as you have been unjustly suspected , well , you must be indemnified .
“ Well , what do you propose to do ? ” she , said at length ; “ come , speak. ” “ I will go this instant and consult the queen , and we will refer the affair at once to parliament. ” “ With which you are at war—is it not so ?
At this , the delight of the mother was almost frantic .
Porthos was perfectly indifferent ; Athos , pale , but resolute ; Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow .
Do you not , father ? ” “ Yes , ” resolutely replied Noirtier .
Silence and fatigue together overcame D ’ Artagnan and sleep overtook him also .
“ So much the better , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Why , about ten or eleven o ’ clock. ” “ Shall we watch by the corpse ? ” “ Of what use would it be ?
A cold , sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches , and yet the drops fell from my forehead .
The footman was withdrawing , but Athos stopped him by a sign .
But if his morals were shocked on the landing , his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber .
I can not now repeat to you , sir , all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of ; it was more than piety , it was more than grief , and I , who am no canter , and hate the Jesuits , said then to myself , ‘ It is really well , and I am very glad that I have not any children ; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does , and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying , I should throw myself into the sea at once , for I could not bear it. ’ ” “ Poor father ! ” murmured the priest .
“ But I am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed. ” “ How have I deviated from those principles , monsieur ? ” asked Monte Cristo , who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity , that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance .
Eleven o ’ clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain .
Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third , and it was now the morning of the twenty-second .
Oh , if she betrayed your Majesty on the side of your honor , it would be quite another thing , and I should be the first to say , ‘ No grace , sire—no grace for the guilty ! ’ Happily , there is nothing of the kind , and your Majesty has just acquired a new proof of it. ” “ That is true , Monsieur Cardinal , ” said the king , “ and you were right , as you always are ; but the queen , not the less , deserves all my anger. ” “ It is you , sire , who have now incurred hers .
“ Then it is for to-day ? ” asked the king .
“ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
I see him ! ” The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole , and had discovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty .
“ Ah , you fear your prisoner should escape ! ” said she .
“ Read ! ” said he , “ read !
Upon his answer in the affirmative , the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone .
“ Counting his treasures , ” replied the governor .
At nine o ’ clock the contract is to be signed at my father-in-law ’ s. ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo .
At last there was Waterloo , and Morrel came no more ; he had done all that was in his power , and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly .
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church !
M. de Monte Cristo saved your life ; you yourself presented him to us .
I went on first , fortunately .
To have you as long as possible near me , to hear your eloquent speech , —which embellishes my mind , strengthens my soul , and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things , if I should ever be free , —so fills my whole existence , that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you , has no longer any hold over me ; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical , but actual .
At this instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort , by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child. ” “ Everything is possible , ” said Monte Cristo , rising from the bench on which he had been sitting ; “ even , ” he added in an inaudible voice , “ even that the procureur be not dead .
Their lackeys likewise were absent , and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other .
By Jove !
But Athos rose likewise , drew his sword , and placed himself in the way .
Besides , I shall only take the time to go and return. ” “ Yes , yes , I understand , ” said Danglars , and then in a low tone , he added , “ To Paris , no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him .
“ No , but in the one next to it , and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing .
But there—now take him—he is your own for as long as you like .
“ We must first extract the steel from the side , ” said he , shaking his head in a significant manner .
But you were just speaking on a very interesting topic , Beauchamp. ” “ I ? ” “ Yes ; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine. ” “ Ah , yes , so I was .
The door at last opened ; Albert de Morcerf entered first , and I began to hope my fears were vain , when , after him , another young man advanced , and the count exclaimed : ‘ Ah , here is the Baron Franz d ’ Épinay ! ’ I summoned all my strength and courage to my support .
He had made some difficulties about going , under pretext that he still suffered from his wound , but D ’ Artagnan had said to him : “ Remain if you like , my dear Monsieur Mouston , but I warn you that Paris will be burnt down to-night ; ” upon which Mousqueton had declared , without asking anything further , that he was ready to follow his master and Monsieur d ’ Artagnan to the end of the world .
“ Oh , unfortunate creature !
Edmond resigned the lugger to the master ’ s care , and went and lay down in his hammock ; but , in spite of a sleepless night , he could not close his eyes for a moment .
If his heart is free , and he will marry Haydée , the daughter of Ali Pasha of Yanina , whom I have brought up with the love of a father , and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me , he will thus accomplish my last wish .
A ground floor , ornamented with arabesques , bathing its terraces in the water , and another floor , looking on the lake , was all which was visible to the eye .
But D ’ Artagnan had reckoned without the wind .
I took one of them by the throat and three-quarters throttled him .
Valentine , will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you ? ” Valentine started .
“ Now , gentlemen , ” said the king in his turn , excited by this sight , “ come , gentlemen , sword in hand ! ” But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king ’ s example .
We shall see better what is going on. ” “ And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for you .
M. de Villefort followed them .
At all events , it is best that he should follow us to Athos ’ s. ” Aramis called Bazin , and , after having ordered him to join them at Athos ’ s residence , said “ Let us go then , ” at the same time taking his cloak , sword , and three pistols , opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin .
The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs , little by little , and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him .
“ It was all up with him , ” continued Aramis ; “ ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly. ” Athos took Lord de Winter ’ s hand and tried to turn the conversation .
The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity .
Caderousse entered hastily .
Tell him all about it , baron. ” “ Why , this is the way of it , ” said the minister , with the gravest air in the world : “ Napoleon lately had a review , and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France , he gave them their dismissal , and exhorted them to ‘ serve the good king. ’ These were his own words , of that I am certain. ” “ Well , Blacas , what think you of this ? ” inquired the king triumphantly , and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him .
Come , there can not be too many. ” 40248m “ Sir , ” said Maximilian , “ you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de Monte Cristo ’ s friend ? ” “ I was not sure , but I thought it might be so .
Athos was meditating ; Porthos was twisting his mustache ; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours , bound in blue velvet .
She had still four days before her .
He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow .
EXECUTION Chapter LXVII .
The queen looked at him , surprised .
It was nearly ten o ’ clock .
“ You see , Edmond , I am not mistaken , and have cause to say , ‘ Spare my son ! ’ ” “ And who told you , madame , that I have any hostile intentions against your son ? ” “ No one , in truth ; but a mother has twofold sight .
“ Well , ” said the young woman , “ what you dreaded has happened .
“ I know not ; I merely suppose so , as I might suppose anything else , ” replied Villefort with a look so fixed , it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness .
We have all wished for this interview , and I trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your objections to Valentine ’ s marriage. ” Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort ’ s blood run cold .
“ My dear friend , ” cried the lieutenant , “ if you say a word I will blow out your brains. ” “ But , sir , ” answered the steward , “ do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon ? ” “ So much the better ; they must be good animals , then. ” “ Sir , I shall call my people. ” “ And I , mine ; I ’ ve ten guards behind me , don ’ t you hear them gallop ?
He says to you jauntily , ‘ Gentlemen , there is fighting going on in Gascony or in Flanders ; go and fight , ’ and you go there .
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy .
These were all who were left of the little troop .
The door of the back-staircase opened , then the side-gate of the garden , and Ali and his master were on the spot with lights .
Porthos , however , found that he had no straw left for himself .
People fight for all sorts of reasons , you know. ” “ I fight in the cause of honor. ” “ Ah , that is something serious. ” “ So serious , that I come to beg you to render me a service. ” “ What is it ? ” “ To be my second. ” “ That is a serious matter , and we will not discuss it here ; let us speak of nothing till we get home .
For the first time in his life , Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire ; the time had come when the implacable spectre , which exists in the mind of every human creature , arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart , “ Thou shalt die ! ” Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase ; first it flies , then despairs , and at last , by the very force of desperation , sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers .
“ Monsieur de Comminges , ” he said , “ pardon me ; we both are servants of the queen , are we not ?
and Madame de Villefort have just left this room , have they not ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And it was they who told you something which made you angry ?
The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering .
As to Monsieur , who had begun the siege , he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it .
Chapter XLVIII .
It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle .
See , I have sold my watch for 100 francs , and the guard and seals for 300 .
“ He should have been— ? ” “ Nothing , ” said the king , “ nothing .
50245m The path was wide , but dark .
30087m “ So we meet again , my travelling friend , do we ? ” cried the countess , extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance ; “ it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly , and still more so to bestow your first visit on me. ” “ Be assured , ” replied Albert , “ that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris , and had known your address , I should have paid my respects to you before this .
’ Twas too brief an enjoyment , and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health ( of which it was perhaps rather the result ) would not long survive such a mode of life .
Monte Cristo , seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it , and not wishing to carry it too far , said : “ Come , gentlemen , —some coffee , we seem to have forgotten it , ” and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn .
It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dantès .
Two men , whom you will find at the door on going out , will serve you as escort .
I will not attempt to argue with you , but I blame you. ” “ Heyday ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ what matters it to me , after all , if Cromwell , who ’ s an Englishman , revolts against his king , who is a Scotchman ?
I wish to kill you , be at rest as to that , but to kill you quietly in a snug , remote place , where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody. ” “ I agree , monsieur ; but do not be too confident .
He preserved this opinion even after the feast , with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence ; but when in the evening he made his master ’ s bed , the chimeras of Planchet faded away .
At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time , and at nine o ’ clock galloped into the yard of Tréville ’ s hôtel .
His first cry was for his father ; but that father was dead. ” “ My father , too , is dead , ” said Morrel .
“ Go ! —do you hear ? ” said Villefort , while d ’ Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out .
“ Whither are you taking me ? ” asked he .
Because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute ; whereas the stranger , on the contrary , in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back .
“ Nothing is easier , madame .
Take a cigar. ” “ Really , my dear Albert , ” replied Lucien , lighting a manilla at a rose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand— “ how happy you are to have nothing to do .
He approached the dying man , and , leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look , he whispered , “ I am—I am—— ” And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it .
I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron ; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them , I ventured to send them back to her , with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands. ” “ You are , then , doubtless , the Count of Monte Cristo , of whom Hermine has talked to me so much ? ” “ You have rightly guessed , madame , ” replied the count .
“ Here I am ! ” exclaimed Porthos .
Come hither , monsieur. ” D ’ Artagnan , who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed , approached , assuming a most deprecating air .
“ Have you been long in the orangery ? ” he asked in a trembling voice , remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury .
Andrea was short and fat ; his visage , marked with brutal cruelty , did not indicate age ; he might be thirty .
Still , as I have already told you , I have an instinctive affection for him , the source of which I can not explain to you .
I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much , and which feared nothing , and I went to the king ’ s attorney. ” “ And this king ’ s attorney was named Villefort ? ” asked Monte Cristo carelessly .
“ What does this mean ? ” demanded he of the cardinal .
“ ’ Tis he ! ” murmured Winter , his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side .
I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity ! ” and a bitter laugh escaped the count .
I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man , and I thought him incapable of committing a crime , or even a theft. ” “ That did more honor to your heart than to your experience , M. Bertuccio .
Milady had guessed aright .
The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust , selfish , and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders .
You asked me the cause of my being late , and why I come disguised .
In the most simple and natural manner possible .
Is he prosperous and happy ? ” “ He died a more wretched , hopeless , heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon. ” A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse , who turned away , and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head .
In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best .
It has four hundred lines , and lasts a minute. ” “ My faith , my dear Aramis , ” said D ’ Artagnan , who detested verses almost as much as he did Latin , “ add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity , and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits. ” “ You will see , ” continued Aramis , “ that it breathes irreproachable passion .
Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction .
Go to bed , or at least lie down in your clothes .
She was charming .
The young girl then continued , speaking slowly , like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating .
That same evening , upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées , the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner .
They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis , and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation .
It was three o ’ clock ; at a quarter past , a merchant presented himself to insure two ships ; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs .
Ah , yes ; we burn , as they say at the game of pincette .
Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde ; and Mazarin , in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach , had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving .
“ We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand , —a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter. ” “ Oh , ” cried Julie , “ I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand , as I now kiss the purse which he has touched .
Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you ; do not let her flee from your embrace .
The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them , and for the honor of the corps even , the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves. ” “ Listen to Monsieur de Tréville , ” said the king ; “ listen to him !
Your mother , Albert , knows that poor house well .
Give me my felt hat , Bernouin. ” The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim .
From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything. ” D ’ Artagnan , entirely overcome by this terrible story , remained motionless and mute , while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart .
Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death , and death then terrified me , and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God .
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage .
“ Well , then , the place ? ” “ Will the Place Royale suit you ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan .
He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk .
“ Alas , yes. ” “ Well , then , instead of pitying me , you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress. ” “ And what sort of revenge would you take ? ” “ I would triumph over her , and supplant my rival. ” “ I will never help you in that , Monsieur Chevalier , ” said Kitty , warmly .
“ I can not be mistaken ; there are your horses !
Yes , yes , to mine ; gad , he was not so proud then , —he was an under-clerk to the good M. Morrel .
“ It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play , but I have said nothing either to the one or to the other .
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below .
“ Yes , mademoiselle , you especially , ” replied the doctor abruptly .
“ If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond , and there existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni , then , indeed , I was lost past redemption , or , at least , my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth .
I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal. ” “ Lower !
“ I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten years .
Instantly afterwards four carbineers , on horseback , appeared on the edge of the wood ; three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive , while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck .
Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table ? ” “ What are the two fish ? ” asked Danglars .
While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly , but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone .
“ Well , ” continued the latter , “ since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes , it is elsewhere , and I must go and find it. ” “ Go , ” said the count deliberately ; “ go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world , that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love , and that I love you , Morrel. ” 40260m “ I will remember it , ” said the young man , “ as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid .
Now , really , let me ask , sir , have you ? —do you believe you have anything to do ?
The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady ; but she declined availing herself of it .
Now , although La Ramee appreciated , as of a certain value , the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance , still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV .
Is it not tempting what I offer you , and is it not an easy thing , since it is only to do thus ?

Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu , and she was to take away Mme .
Faria sat up to receive him , avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death .

Fortunately , you won ’ t be laid up more than a fortnight .
Porthos , I doubt if you can wear it ; but should it be too tight , never mind , you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers. ” It happened , however , that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions , so , save that some few of the seams split , his uniform fitted Porthos perfectly .

You have heard what I said ?
As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him .
The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do .
“ Sir , ” said Villefort , in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods , and of which they can not , or will not , divest themselves in society , “ sir , the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks .
Ah , why were you not there , gentlemen ?
His visit was announced to the governor , who , on hearing that he came from the cardinal , went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door .
Well , the Abbé Adelmonte took a rabbit , and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage .
Make use of it , I pray you , for your pleasure or your business. ” The young men wished to decline , but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them .
All went well till they arrived at Chantilly , which they reached about eight o ’ clock in the morning .
Their horses flew , and they never ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis .

Giovanni , light a torch , ” he added , “ and give it to his excellency. ” Giovanni obeyed .
“ Well , then , ” resumed Faria with a bitter smile , “ let me answer your question in full , by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of the Château d ’ If , for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity ; and , in all probability , I should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children , if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair. ” Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless ; at length he said : “ Then you abandon all hope of escape ? ” “ I perceive its utter impossibility ; and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve. ” “ Nay , be not discouraged .
As for you , my dear lieutenant , I promise you nothing ; but if you bring him back to me , dead or alive , you may ask all you wish. ” “ To horse , Porthos ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , taking his friend by the hand .
He has but one fault , he is somewhat wilful ; but really , on referring for the moment to what he said , do you truly believe that Mithridates used these precautions , and that these precautions were efficacious ? ” “ I think so , madame , because I myself have made use of them , that I might not be poisoned at Naples , at Palermo , and at Smyrna—that is to say , on three several occasions when , but for these precautions , I must have lost my life. ” “ And your precautions were successful ? ” “ Completely so. ” “ Yes , I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this sort. ” “ Indeed ? ” said the count with an air of surprise , remarkably well counterfeited ; “ I really did not remember. ” “ I inquired of you if poisons acted equally , and with the same effect , on men of the North as on men of the South ; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South. ” “ And that is the case , ” observed Monte Cristo .
much Monsieur Mordaunt would care .
What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation ; what a delicious abbé you would have made ! ” “ Oh , it ’ s only a temporary postponement , ” replied Aramis ; “ I shall be one someday .
Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance , and suspecting that something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be informed , he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was , and recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards , he put his horse into a gallop , and rode straight up to D ’ Artagnan .
“ Now I think of it , you can do better , ” said Danglars .
It was a mistake. ” “ Yes , which made fools laugh , which caused the minister to have a sleepless night , which has caused the minister ’ s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper , but which has cost me 700,000 francs. ” “ But , sir , ” said Hermine suddenly , “ if all this is , as you say , caused by M. Debray , why , instead of going direct to him , do you come and tell me of it ?
She looked at him in amazement .
“ Yes , and without violence , ” said Louise .
The people who wrote are Anglo-Germans , you know. ” “ Oh , as for the composition of the letter , there is nothing to be said ; but as regards the competency of the document , I certainly have doubts. ” “ Is it possible ? ” asked the count , assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor .
“ ‘ Yes , yes , I ! ’ replied he .
“ My dear sir , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I understand your emotion ; you must have time to recover yourself .
Athos , on his part , had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion , and who was named Grimaud .
Ah !
However , accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian life—a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions. ” Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer ; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty .
Through this the king was to escape the next night , and , hidden by the black covering of the scaffold , was to change his dress for that of a workman , slip out with his deliverers , pass the sentinels , who would suspect nothing , and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich .

When the game was over , the duke , laughing at La Ramee for his bad play , offered these men two louis d ’ or to go and drink his health , with their four other comrades .
Franz now listened to it for the third time ; yet its notes , so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions , thrilled through the soul of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it .
“ And Bazin ? ” asked Athos .
He married a woman who keeps a confectioner ’ s shop in the Rue des Lombards , for he ’ s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats ; he ’ s now a citizen of Paris .
If you die , I will die with you ; that is all I can say to you. ” “ Silence ! ” cried Felton ; “ we are here. ” In fact , they touched the sloop .
All my hopes are blighted , my heart is broken , my life a burden , everything around me is sad and mournful ; earth has become distasteful to me , and human voices distract me .
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter .
But you are here , my dear fellow , let us speak of you .
I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give you. ” “ Yes. ” “ And by accustoming her to that poison , you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison ? ” Noirtier ’ s joy continued .
I am a sailor. ” Not a second was to be lost .
It happened that on this particular night the minister ’ s box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray , who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf , who again , upon his rejection of it by Mercédès , sent it to Danglars , with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening , in the event of their accepting the box in question .
On my right I saw the tree , behind me the rock .
Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends , that is to say , in the first place , the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard .
So you see , being in constant fear of being forced from that position , I am armed to the teeth. ” “ And yet , ” said D ’ Artagnan , laughing , “ it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties_. ” And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans .
D ’ Artagnan and Athos refused them .
Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon , the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances , to obtain from the queen authority for Mme .
The worthy merchant had been more fortunate .
You will be well fed there , if the hostess remains the same .
Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke ’ s arms on it , and seemingly cooked to a turn , as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust .
It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people , generally , alone attended .
This man might , after all , be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible. ” “ Upon my word , ” said Dantès , “ you make me shudder .
Chapter XXXI .
“ To give your majesty ’ s reply to those who await it. ” “ Stay , marechal ; I will not appear to parley with rebels. ” “ Madame , I have pledged my word , and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to return. ” Anne of Austria ’ s eyes shot glances of fire .
She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake ; but D ’ Artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her .
“ You are about to see , ” said Mousqueton , looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning , “ you are about to see , Blaisois , how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty. ” “ My cloak , ” said Grimaud , from the bottom of the hold .
However , in an hour I shall know all .
‘ Well , ’ asked the president , ‘ what is your decision ? ’ 40206m “ ‘ I have no reply to make , ’ said the count in a low tone .
Spada , a prudent man , and greatly attached to his only nephew , a young captain of the highest promise , took paper and pen , and made his will .
MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man who listened to her , Milady continued her recital .
“ Oh , my God , my God ! ” cried Milady ; “ when I supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due , thou knowest it is not my own vengeance I pursue , but the deliverance of a whole nation that I implore ! ” “ Do you know him , then ? ” asked Felton .
Why should you expose your game to your adversary ?
I have more than once intended witnessing an execution , but I have never been able to make up my mind ; and you , Albert ? ” “ I , ” replied the viscount , — “ I saw Castaing executed , but I think I was rather intoxicated that day , for I had quitted college the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern. ” “ Besides , it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris , that you should not see one anywhere else ; when you travel , it is to see everything .
His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss , whence he awoke , bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen .
Take him out and shoot him. ” The prisoner turned pale .
“ Benedetto ? ” he muttered ; “ fatality ! ” “ Half-past six o ’ clock has just struck , M. Bertuccio , ” said the count severely ; “ I ordered dinner at that hour , and I do not like to wait ; ” and he returned to his guests , while Bertuccio , leaning against the wall , succeeded in reaching the dining-room .
1.F.3 .
You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars , in order that I may execute Edmond ’ s last wishes. ” The agitation of Caderousse became extreme , and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow .
my fist is strong enough I swear , ” cried Porthos , extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton .
But Morrel saw nothing ; he had grasped the hand of Valentine , and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets .
to you—the only just , good , and compassionate being I have met with !
And then , it must be confessed , Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely loved .
It was time , for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man-of-war .
You , whom I expected last , you arrive at five minutes to ten , when the time fixed was half-past !
Bonacieux , who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre , should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night , at the risk of being abducted a second time ?

and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville ; and if the worthy Broussel were there , whom you so stupidly helped arrest , I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks. ” “ Well , sir , I will obey you , although I do not understand you. ” “ It is unnecessary for you to understand .
“ Oh , feel for me , who could offer millions to that poor woman , but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved .
The jailer stared .
I know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune .
I told him very humbly—for I could not conceal from myself the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majesty ’ s Musketeers—I told him I was quite ready to submit to his conditions .
Another motive had influenced Albert ’ s selection of his seat , —who knew but that , thus advantageously placed , he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman , and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage , or a place in a princely balcony , from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival ?
D ’ Artagnan , following the strange custom of the times , considered himself at Paris as on a campaign , neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders—Spain yonder , woman here .
And yet it appears , in spite of all your diligence , you have arrived too late. ” “ You see ! ” said Athos , pointing to Mme .
This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him ; neither in the antechamber , nor in the corridor , nor beneath the great door .
“ I have heard , ” said Blaisois , “ that port is a very good wine. ” “ Excellent ! ” exclaimed Mousqueton , smacking his lips .
Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads. ” “ But observe , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ that there is a woman in the affair—a woman carried off , a woman who is doubtless threatened , tortured perhaps , and all because she is faithful to her mistress. ” “ Beware , D ’ Artagnan , beware , ” said Aramis .
When you come to Paris , I will return all this. ” “ I will not refuse ; I intend going there soon , and since you allow me , I will pay you a visit .
I think he has not been arrested , and as I am his wife ’ s confessor , if she knows where he is I shall know it too. ” “ Very well , sir , find this man , and when you have found him bring him to me. ” “ We will be with you at six o ’ clock , my lord. ” “ Go , my dear curate , and may God assist you ! ” “ And you , sir ? ” continued Gondy , turning to the curate of St. Sulpice .
Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited .
“ I must have left it in my room , ” she said .
Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now , and if it was not a sublime , it was , at least , a curious spectacle .
“ In that case you must be horribly bored , and have my sympathy. ” “ The fact is , I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror .

Make less hubbub and think more deeply .
She was looking at the sea , and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky .
PORTHOS Instead of returning directly home , D ’ Artagnan alighted at the door of M. de Tréville , and ran quickly up the stairs .
“ That is impossible , ” replied the governor .
As for her , she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips , and repeated , blaspheming , that terrible name of God , by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him .
“ Not yet , ” replied Porthos .
A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard .
I thought I recognized him and I was not mistaken. ” “ Whom do you mean ? ” asked Aramis .
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger , the queen , when his death was announced to her , would not believe the fact , and even imprudently exclaimed , “ it is false ; he has just written to me ! ” But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence ; Laporte , detained in England , as everyone else had been , by the orders of Charles I. , arrived , and was the bearer of the duke ’ s dying gift to the queen .
The company was then heard departing ; then the door of the closet in which D ’ Artagnan was , was opened , and Mme .
“ May I not drink to your health , and you to mine ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of M. Bonacieux .
‘ You ? ’ “ ‘ To interminable , ineffaceable infamy ! ’ “ ‘ You ? ’ repeated I. Oh , I declare to you , Felton , I thought him mad !
Now , as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence , it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer , exact , precise , positive .
Watch her arrival , for she has great and terrible projects .
“ The lackeys were brought by the cries she made .
D ’ Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms .
“ For what purpose ? ” “ Upon my honor , I will instantly return it to you .
“ I see , my lord , I am to be taken back to the Bastile. ” “ You are sagacious. ” “ I shall return thither , my lord , but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me. ” “ You ?
“ Such are for royalty , and we are simple commoners. ” “ Speak not of crowns .
My father ’ s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects , which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding , and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time , although , he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married , M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson. ” M. de Villefort had scarcely said this , when the door opened , and Barrois appeared .
The general fell , then , in a loyal duel , and not in ambush as it might have been reported .
“ And now , ” said the queen , “ we are forgetting one very necessary thing. ” “ What is that , madame ? ” “ Money. ” Mme .
Without doubt he recognized D ’ Artagnan , for he became deadly pale ; doubtless the musketeer knew him , for his hair stood up on his head .
The man he sacrificed to his ambition , that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father ’ s faults , appeared to him pale and threatening , leading his affianced bride by the hand , and bringing with him remorse , not such as the ancients figured , furious and terrible , but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death .
Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future ?
As the stranger asked the question , he dragged the table beneath the window .
We are here to guard the gate , and no one whom we do not know shall pass. ” “ What is to be done ? ” said Porthos .
“ My friend , ” said she , “ how came you here ?
“ And you can not deny it ! ” added Villefort , extending his hand toward her , as though to seize her in the name of justice .
Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron , and D ’ Artagnan a Captain .
I spoke to Benedetto alone , and proposed to him to accompany me , endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve .
Help me out of Paris ; help me out of France ! ” “ I can not take you , however , to the siege of La Rochelle , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Yes , ” she said , “ and you have still preserved this love in your heart—one can only love once—and did you ever see her again ? ” 30309m “ Never. ” “ Never ? ” “ I never returned to the country where she lived. ” “ To Malta ? ” “ Yes ; Malta. ” “ She is , then , now at Malta ? ” “ I think so. ” “ And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer ? ” “ Her , —yes. ” “ But only her ; do you then still hate those who separated you ? ” “ I hate them ?
I love you as one loves a father , brother , husband !
I make no requests or commands ; I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own , and then judge for yourself. ” The young man reflected for a moment , then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes , and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets , the insignia of his rank .
“ I , my lord , ” said the latter , “ I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt .
Planchet , much surprised at the inquiry , turned back .
The curtains were half drawn , and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries .
Speak ! ” The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him .
“ If there is a third shot , ” said he to himself , “ I am a lost man. ” He immediately , therefore , took to his heels and ran toward the camp , with the swiftness of the young men of his country , so renowned for their agility ; but whatever might be his speed , the first who fired , having had time to reload , fired a second shot , and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat , and carried it ten paces from him .
When you arrived , Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath some minutes ; she then had a fit , which I took to be simply a nervous attack , and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed , and her limbs and neck appear stiffened , that I became really alarmed .
“ Well , Louis , ” said Anne , “ why do you not kiss me ? ” “ I thought you were angry with me , madame ; you sent me away. ” “ I do not send you away , but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you. ” “ You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to-day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion. ” “ Sire ! ” interposed Laporte , in order to turn the subject , “ to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle ? ” “ To any one , Laporte , ” the child said ; and then added in a loud voice , “ to any one except Mancini. ” Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarin ’ s and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself , although placed near his person by the minister .
M. de Tréville entertained good company , wholly anticardinalist , though .
The army marched silently , the prince at the head of the column .
As for the cellar , I have searched every part and poor stuff I found. ” “ Monsieur Mouston , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to. ” Then taking Porthos aside : “ My dear Du Vallon , ” he said , “ here you are in full dress most fortunately , for I am going to take you to the cardinal ’ s. ” “ Gracious me !
Calm and resolute , he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel , —calculated its probable method of approach ; retreated , if at all , as a point of strategy and not from cowardice ; was quick to see an opening for attack , and won victory at a single thrust .
I saw him today for the first time , and he can tell you on what occasion ; he came to demand the rent of my lodging .
Go. ” The valet bowed and retired , and Albert returned to his inventory .
“ Half-past one only ? ” said he .
“ Come , sweep away all that for me !
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy .
Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year , from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs .
That ’ s because I don ’ t care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers .
Oh , am I happy enough for that ? ” “ Yes ; you have called Haydée your sister , —let her become so indeed , Valentine ; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me ; protect her , for ” ( the count ’ s voice was thick with emotion ) “ henceforth she will be alone in the world. ” “ Alone in the world ! ” repeated a voice behind the count , “ and why ? ” Monte Cristo turned around ; Haydée was standing pale , motionless , looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement .
They were guarded , not only by armed men , but even by women and children .
“ Well ? ” said the baroness .
These two men met at one point and that was , cunning ; had they been actuated equally by courage , the one would have done great things for the other .
I am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth , and shall be happy if you will accompany me , viscount. ” “ Willingly. ” “ Then it is settled ? ” “ Yes , but where ? ” “ I have told you , where the air is pure , where every sound soothes , where one is sure to be humbled , however proud may be his nature .
Already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht .
France enfeebled , the authority of her sovereign contemned , her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence , her enemies within her frontiers—all proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence .
It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled .
Are we not their Majesties ’ servants ? ” At that moment Porthos entered .
She lived in the Place Royale—then the fashionable quarter—at Number 6 , and he undertook to call and take D ’ Artagnan with him in order to introduce him .
I never saw a man with a nobler air than his. ” “ Without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can , ” said Porthos .
Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence ? ” “ Not the slightest , but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences. ” “ But who perpetrated that joke , let me ask ?
“ My faith , my good host , ” said D ’ Artagnan , filling the two glasses , “ I asked for a bottle of your best wine , and if you have deceived me , you will be punished in what you have sinned ; for seeing that I hate drinking by myself , you shall drink with me .
Do you understand now , ” said the captain , “ why no complaints are made to the government , and why the vessel never reaches port ? ” It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition , Franz would have hesitated , but now that they had started , he thought it would be cowardly to draw back .
He shall assume a disguise , and place himself in front of the convent .
“ You no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door ? ” “ Certainly , your excellency .
“ Wait , it ought to be there in my pocket ; it speaks of his return , does it not , Porthos ? ” All Gascon as he was , D ’ Artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood .
Remember to go to the count on the 26th May at seven o ’ clock in the evening .
The two friends were perfectly stupefied .
Chapter 20 .
I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli ; should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino , the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks , and the centre with white , having a large cross in red marked on it. ” “ And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution ? ” “ Send one of your men , disguised as a penitent friar , and I will give it to him .
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness .
I requested him to call , and when I came to the Louvre I left orders if he came , to desire him to wait. ” “ Let him be sent for instantly. ” “ Your Majesty ’ s orders shall be executed ; but— ” “ But what ? ” “ But the queen will perhaps refuse to obey. ” “ My orders ? ” “ Yes , if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king. ” “ Well , that she may have no doubt on that head , I will go and inform her myself. ” “ Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture. ” “ Yes , Duke , yes , I know you are very indulgent toward the queen , too indulgent , perhaps ; we shall have occasion , I warn you , at some future period to speak of that. ” “ Whenever it shall please your Majesty ; but I shall be always happy and proud , sire , to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see reign between you and the Queen of France. ” “ Very well , Cardinal , very well ; but , meantime , send for Monsieur the Keeper of the Seals .
In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new-born child .
They will not dare to refuse me then ; and I will return to Paris , and will see you again , and will be happy for an instant .
About this time , a band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be much spoken of .
“ Where ? ” asked Maximilian .
D ’ Artagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his voice .
He had noticed that a few rays , not of daylight , but from a lamp , penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door ; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy , which , owing to the leathern bottle containing it , sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars .
A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship .
Now , will you taste our wine , and without prejudice say what you think of it ? ” “ Thank you , my friend , thank you ; unfortunately , I have just breakfasted. ” “ Well , ” said Porthos , “ arrange the table , Mousqueton , and while we breakfast , D ’ Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us. ” “ Willingly , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ See , ” said d ’ Avrigny to Villefort , “ nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow .
“ What do you say of this ? ” asked the queen .
“ The fact is , one can not remain thus , with a sword hanging eternally over his head , ” said Athos .
“ It is you , Mordaunt , ” he said .
0259m “ Yes , sir ; and , as he said , it was an ancient name .
He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier ; when their hands touched , he felt as though he should swoon ; every pulse beat with violence , and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears .
The moon , which had shone for a short time , disappeared behind the clouds ; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert , the ocean , and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows .
While singing , Milady listened .

D ’ Artagnan knelt as well as the rest , received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross ; but when Bazin passed in his turn , with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking , in all humility , the very last , D ’ Artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe .
“ Let us go , ” repeated D ’ Artagnan .
Jealousy , fury , offended pride , all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love , urged her to make a revelation ; but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination , and above all , that D ’ Artagnan would also be lost to her forever .
And your third attack ( if , indeed , you should have another ) will find you at liberty .
Still , in spite of this , Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres ; but , alas , his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away , and one of the most worthy representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure .
“ Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened , and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans. ” “ Sir , ” said the count , “ the world , unjust as it is , will be pleased with your resolution ; your friends will be proud of you , and M. d ’ Épinay , even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry , which he will not do , would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty. ” At the conclusion of these words , the count rose to depart .
“ One may well perceive , young man , that you are inexperienced .
“ Oh , that ’ s nothing !
I swear to you , I protest— ” “ Oh , but God is above !
As to the monk , without withdrawing the poniard from the wound , he ran to the window , opened it , leaped out into the flowers of a small garden , glided onward to the stable , took out his mule , went out by a back gate , ran to a neighbouring thicket , threw off his monkish garb , took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier , clothed himself in it , went on foot to the first post , secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris .
On the other side of the house , to match with the library , was the conservatory , ornamented with rare flowers , that bloomed in china jars ; and in the midst of the greenhouse , marvellous alike to sight and smell , was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth .
It was a terrible moment for the young man .
The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself .
It was a kind of covered wagon , painted black , and was one of the first to arrive .
The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them .
The king called the cardinal .
Comminges returned to his post .
“ And am I not a hundred times better thus ? ” cried Eugénie , smoothing the scattered curls of her hair , which had now quite a masculine appearance ; “ and do you not think me handsomer so ? ” “ Oh , you are beautiful—always beautiful ! ” cried Louise .
It was scarcely eleven o ’ clock in the morning , and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Tréville , who could not fail to think the manner in which D ’ Artagnan had left him a little cavalier .
Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards , who led him , while awaiting further orders , to a little terrace commanding the sea ; and then the baron hastened to the duke ’ s chamber .

He returned thus , formidable and implacable , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand .
Only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole. ” “ Good !
It is not he !

So far as I can judge , I suppose this to be a quarter of my father ’ s revenue. ” “ I , ” said Danglars , “ have always intended giving my daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry ; she is , besides , my sole heiress. ” “ All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing .
He had a remarkably fine garden , full of vegetables , flowers , and fruit .

“ So you like it , you rogue ? ” “ So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living. ” “ Do you see , ” said Caderousse , “ all my happiness is marred by one thought ? ” “ What is that ? ” “ That I am dependent on another , I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly. ” “ Do not let that disturb you , I have enough for two. ” “ No , truly ; you may believe me if you will ; at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse. ” “ Good Caderousse ! ” “ So much so , that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs. ” “ Yes , you wished to speak to me ; but was it indeed remorse , tell me ? ” “ True remorse ; and , besides , an idea had struck me. ” Andrea shuddered ; he always did so at Caderousse ’ s ideas .

He therefore found D ’ Artagnan alone , and as it was nearly eight o ’ clock he took the young man with him .
Breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone—she , a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared herself mentally to Judith , the terrible Jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke .
“ Dead ! ” repeated a third voice .
The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter re-entered it .

“ That you inherit from your mother. ” “ Truly , from my mother , Leonora Corsinari. ” “ How much may it amount to ? ” “ Indeed , sir , ” said Andrea , “ I assure you I have never given the subject a thought , but I suppose it must have been at least two millions. ” Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure , or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up .
Mordaunt darted to the steps , understood all , uttered a cry , as if his very heart was pierced , and fell fainting on the stone steps .

“ What company ? ” “ Company of Tréville. ” “ Advance , and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour. ” The three companions advanced rather humbly—for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves—leaving Athos the post of speaker .
“ I shall , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ and instantly. ” “ In truth , my young friend , you will act rightly , ” said the gentleman , pressing the Gascon ’ s hand with an affection almost paternal ; “ and God grant that this woman , who has scarcely entered into your life , may not leave a terrible trace in it ! ” And Athos bowed to D ’ Artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts .
Do you think , ” she said , with a ghastly smile , “ that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations ? ” Mazarin , overcome by this determination , read the two letters .
The young man felt her press his hand , and comprehended that this was a sentiment , not of coquetry , but of gratitude because of his departure .
“ Good-evening , madame , ” said the banker ; “ good-evening , M. Debray. ” Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day .

The two children met , sat down near each other , let their flocks mingle together , played , laughed , and conversed together ; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice ’ s flock from those of Baron Cervetri , and the children returned to their respective farms , promising to meet the next morning .

She treats her children ill , but she always welcomes strangers. ” “ Ah , father , ” said Albert with a smile , “ it is evident you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo ; he despises all honors , and contents himself with those written on his passport. ” “ That is the most just remark , ” replied the stranger , “ I ever heard made concerning myself. ” “ You have been free to choose your career , ” observed the Count of Morcerf , with a sigh ; “ and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers. ” “ Precisely , monsieur , ” replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze .

I take that God to witness , at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years , that I would have sacrificed my life to you , and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it .

He is a proud soul—he is a man by himself !
Athos led his guest into a dining-room of moderate size , the windows of which opened on one side on a garden , on the other on a hot-house full of magnificent flowers .
I ought to have consulted you on the point , and have had some dishes prepared expressly. ” “ Did you know me better , ” returned the count , smiling , “ you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself , who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples , polenta at Milan , olla podrida at Valencia , pilau at Constantinople , curry in India , and swallows ’ nests in China .

“ Oh , that is very good—indeed , it is very good ! ” said Louise , looking at her with admiration ; “ but that beautiful black hair , those magnificent braids , which made all the ladies sigh with envy , —will they go under a man ’ s hat like the one I see down there ? ” “ You shall see , ” said Eugénie .

The old man ’ s declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort ; she gradually approached the invalid , and said : “ Then , doubtless , dear M. Noirtier , you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson , Edward de Villefort ? ” The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible , and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred .

‘ Humph ! ’ thought I , ‘ that looks like my handiwork ; I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other. ’ And , in fact , it was that unfortunate Scotchman , Parry ’ s brother , you know , on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his strength .
“ He has returned , ” said he .
“ And where am I ? ” inquired Monte Cristo laughingly .
If you do escape , remember that the poor abbé , whom all the world called mad , was not so .
D ’ Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between Porthos and the procurator ’ s wife , and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped .
A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization ; and imperceptibly , D ’ Artagnan , always in the camp , always on horseback , always in garrison , became ( I know not how in the present age one would express it ) a typical trooper .
Refer to your papers. ” “ You are not Busoni ? —you are not Monte Cristo ?
“ Where am I ? ” he asked himself .
The man whipped his animals , which cleared a way through the crowd ; but on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop ; the carriage was upset , the horses carried off , stifled , mangled by the crowd .
help ! ” cried a voice , whose mournful accents , reaching the four friends , seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean .
“ Now let us go. ” 50205m These words had scarcely escaped him , when the carriage was on its way , and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement .
0313m Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa , under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht .
This time I will know the assassin , and will pursue him. ” “ Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her , ” said d ’ Avrigny .
“ So far , then , ” said Danglars , mentally , “ all has gone as I would have it .
“ Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of God ’ s justice. ” “ He will be found. ” “ Well , ” said the cardinal , “ then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required. ” “ Your Eminence is right , ” replied Milady ; “ and I have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is—that is , to announce to his Grace , on the part of your Eminence , that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by Madame the Constable ; that you have proofs of the interview granted at the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other than the Duke of Buckingham ; that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens , with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place , and portraits of the actors who figured in them ; that Montague is in the Bastille , and that the torture may make him say things he remembers , and even things he has forgotten ; that you possess a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse , found in his Grace ’ s lodging , which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it , but her in whose name it was written .
He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation ; he exaggerated to himself the power of Milady .
Through the darkness Franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing , and then , as they rounded a rocky point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated .
“ It is some superior officer making his night rounds , ” said Athos .
These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were , and on the other into a large square chamber , entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken .
The governor then went out , and words of pity fell on Dantès ’ listening ears , mingled with brutal laughter .
On Tuesday , the theatres open at ten o ’ clock in the morning , as Lent begins after eight at night .
As to Haydée , these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment , for she ceased speaking , her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm ; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina , which , like a magic mirror , seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched .
Aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room .
By means of the two windows looking into the street , Albert could see all that passed ; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men , who always want to see the world traverse their horizon , even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare .
Milady , as Athos had foreseen , on finding the two men that awaited her , made no difficulty in following them .
“ I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf , for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences , and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held .
At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ , a priest arrived in some haste , forced his way through the soldiers , and , advancing to the chief of the brotherhood , gave him a folded paper .
Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D ’ Artagnan .
He saw a lady , a fashionable , elegantly dressed lady , and yet the door remained almost closed .
“ Valentine , ” said the count , “ summon up all your courage ; still the beatings of your heart ; do not let a sound escape you , and feign to be asleep ; then you will see. ” Valentine seized the count ’ s hand .
Good heaven !
D ’ Artagnan ’ s plan was very simple .
Is not the greatest thief in the world , Monsieur ( the king ’ s secretary ) Le Camus , who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions ? ” The dog shook his head .
And besides , even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time ; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle .
“ Would you have given up the letter , Aramis ? ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ What , again ? ” she exclaimed , in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob ; “ really , you pain me. ” A long silence followed ; the peach , like the grapes , fell to the ground .
“ Pray learn , Monsieur Olivain , that people like us are not to be served by cowards .
Bonacieux wept all day , like a true mercer , not being at all a military man , as he himself informed us .
“ What are you waiting for ? ” said Caderousse .
The result was , that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose .
Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me , and the next instant a dull , heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase .
Take care .
Monsieur Mousqueton !
It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber , for without it he would have been unable , perhaps , to reach the vessel—certainly to return to shore , should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention .
The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence .
There was the crime , Bertuccio—that was where you became really culpable. ” “ True , excellency , that was the crime , the real crime , for in that I acted like a coward .
He had within his reach his pistols and carbine , and Ali , standing near him , held one of the small Arabian hatchets , whose form has not varied since the Crusades .
On landing , the count turned towards the cemetery , where he felt sure of finding Morrel .
This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named , but not until after a stormy discussion , generalissimo of the army of the king , out of Paris .
“ Tell them this , Athos , ” resumed D ’ Artagnan ; “ thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the Lord. ” Athos repeated D ’ Artagnan ’ s words .
“ Oh , those Villeforts are an accursed race ! ” “ Truly they are , ” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone .
Albert , besides being an elegant , well-looking young man , was also possessed of considerable talent and ability ; moreover , he was a viscount—a recently created one , certainly , but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent , and a genealogical tree is equally estimated , whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 ; but to crown all these advantages , Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of 50,000 livres , a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris .
He called it using his advantages .
Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post-horses .
“ Yes , sir ; at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened .
I have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county , and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around. ” And Porthos heaved another sigh .
“ I was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls ; and , _pardieu_ , I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each .
A man arrived yesterday from Yanina , bringing a formidable array of documents ; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article , he told us it should be inserted in some other paper. ” Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit , and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcerf .
The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled .
“ Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets. ” Villefort went immediately .
Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer , and the horses galloped off .
He sat down without saying a word to anybody , and began to reflect .
“ What is that news ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan .
Adapt your promises to their respective characters. ” “ What shall I promise ? ” “ That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent. ” “ But what are we to do ? ” “ Make your mind easy ; when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you ; wait till that time arrives and find out your friends. ” “ My lord , perhaps they are not in Paris .
Monte Cristo was at home ; only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room .
and how did it happen ? ” “ I will tell you all about it , ” replied Mousqueton .
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game , which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men , was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria .
Benedetto , you are fallen into terrible hands ; they are ready to open for you—make use of them .
I will offer six millions , and I will content myself with the rest , if they will only give me my liberty. ” “ On my word , ” said the inspector in a low tone , “ had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad , I should believe what he says. ” “ I am not mad , ” replied Faria , with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners .
It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the minister .
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face , framed with black hair and whiskers , the only expression of which was icy impassibility .
I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her .
It was for this reason , as he said to those around him , that he had put on his cloak ; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully , all admired his embroidered baldric , and D ’ Artagnan more than anyone .
Bonacieux , “ my punishment is drawing to a close .
I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty ’ s Musketeers , toward whom he is unjust , and that he has not obtained his information from good sources. ” “ The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille , from the duke himself .
It is his way , and you must take him as you find him. ” At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act .
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change .
Grimaud smiled .
“ Gentlemen , ” cried the coadjutor , tightening his sash , which he wore , after the fashion of the ancient military prelates , over his archiepiscopal simar , “ there ’ s the enemy approaching .
Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still more .
Seven o ’ clock in the morning !
On hearing the sound of his footsteps , the two men threw themselves in each other ’ s arms , and while they were in the midst of this embrace , the count entered .
Well yes , you are right ; that name has still its charms , and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly .
Give me your horse , Porthos .
The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week ; and seeing them , Dantès sighed heavily .
“ Explain , my child , ” he said , “ Explain , my child , ” he said , “ explain—where did you find this purse ? ” “ In a house in the Allées de Meilhan , No .
“ Your arrival here , without waiting my visit at your house today , looks well , sir , ” said Albert .
I can manage your business for you .
D ’ Artagnan took possession of his command .
“ Athos !
“ He is not curious , ” thought D ’ Artagnan .
“ Well , you rascal , what is it ?
The agitated figures , apparently wild with terror , consisted of Groslow , who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors .
What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures ?
From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier .
Felton walked into the sea up to his middle , being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody .
What could he say ?
“ Don ’ t you say , dear D ’ Artagnan , that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her ? ” “ I believe so , at least. ” “ In that case Porthos will assist us. ” “ And how so , if you please ? ” “ Why , by your marchioness , your duchess , your princess .
A secret voice whispered to him , at the bottom of his heart , that he was but an instrument of vengeance , that he was only caressed till he had given death ; but pride , but self-love , but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs .
Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling , but withdrew then , immediately , as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven , and that other judge named God .
These protestations were nothing for Mme .
That is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life !
Albert , who was a great smoker , and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris , approached the table , and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_ .
When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed , lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another .
Shall you keep it or send it back ? ” “ I shall keep it , Aramis , and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it .
And you say that Monsieur d ’ Artagnan was one of those four men ? ” “ He led the enterprise. ” “ And who were the others ? ” “ I leave it to Monsieur d ’ Artagnan to name them , my lord .
The approach was not such as to prepossess people—an ill-smelling , dark passage , a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard ; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the Grand Châtelet .
He cried out , and staggered against the wall like a drunken man , then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé ’ s cell to his own , and said , “ I must be alone , to think over all this. ” When he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed , where the turnkey found him in the evening visit , sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , dumb and motionless as a statue .
Chapter XXXIX .
D ’ Artagnan mounted the staircase , followed by his prisoner , who in his turn was followed by the soldier , and entered Mazarin ’ s ante-room .
Eh ?
D ’ Artagnan , however , gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take , and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey .
“ A prisoner has escaped from the Château d ’ If , and they are firing the alarm gun , ” replied Dantès .
Both had recently come into the country .
“ Into the service—the king ’ s service ? ” Mousqueton trembled ; even his fat , smooth cheeks shook as he spoke , and he looked at D ’ Artagnan with an air of reproach ; he staggered , and his voice was almost choked .
“ Yes , skirmishers ; that is to say , highway robbers. ” “ At them ! ” cried Raoul .
One day—it was the morning of the day my story begins—the king , Louis XIV. , then ten years of age , went in state , under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small-pox , to Notre Dame .
“ You will be served , thus , madame , three times a day , ” said he .
Remain , then , where you are , and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue .
When the reading was finished , he remained silent , with knitted brows .
Days and weeks passed away , then months—Dantès still waited ; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight .
But listen to me , Valentine , and I will tell you all about it .
M. de Morcerf opened the door himself , and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk , rang , and entered the open door with his servant .
Chapter 95 .
I claim , then , the right to choose my opponent .
“ Your name ? ” cried his Eminence , for the third time .
“ Sire , it was impossible to learn ; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper. ” “ And how did this despatch reach you ? ” inquired the king .
“ I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested , and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister. ” “ I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence , first , because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results .
If he wanted Valentine , he closed his right eye only , and if Barrois , the left .
“ Stay there , ” said Aramis ; “ I shall return immediately. ” The two friends went toward the shed .
When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba , my brother instantly joined the army , was slightly wounded at Waterloo , and retired with the army beyond the Loire. ” “ But that is the history of the Hundred Days , M. Bertuccio , ” said the count ; “ unless I am mistaken , it has been already written. ” “ Excuse me , excellency , but these details are necessary , and you promised to be patient. ” “ Go on ; I will keep my word. ” “ One day we received a letter .
The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing ; and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess .

de Chevreuse and Mme .
From the top of an eminence D ’ Artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat , in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint Maur .

Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken. ” “ And what bastion is it ? ” asked a dragoon , with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked .
“ Start , start ! ” said D ’ Artagnan .
Two open ... ings have been made in these caves ; the treasure is in the furthest a ... ngle in the second ; which treasure I bequeath and leave en ... tire to him as my sole heir .
The striking points of his face were effaced ; he had still a nose , but his cheeks , fattened out , each took a portion of it unto themselves ; his chin had joined his throat ; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks ; his hair , cut straight in holy guise , covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows .
“ Yes. ” “ Well , read the letter again .
I can not tell you how long we remained in this state ; at that period I did not even know what time meant .
Certain Dantès could not escape , the gendarmes released him .
this treasure will be lost .
Morrel , overpowered , turned around in the armchair ; a delicious torpor permeated every vein .
Dantès was about to speak ; but feeling himself urged forward , and having neither the power nor the intention to resist , he mounted the steps , and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes ; the two others took their places opposite , and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones .
The faint glimpses of the pale moon , hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky , whitened the gravel walks that led to the house , but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies , in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery .
It is a long time since we have had a battle , eh , Porthos ? ” “ Battle ! ” cried Porthos .
The surgeon approached the dying man , who seemed to have fainted .

Let us return to M. Franz d ’ Épinay .

“ Go , young men !
“ If she objects to your marrying M. d ’ Épinay , she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition. ” “ No , Maximilian , it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects , it is marriage itself. ” “ Marriage ?
“ Has this woman been relating her crimes to you ?
Day came ; the table had disappeared , only I had still the knife in my hand .
He took with him several of his subordinates , and amongst them Dantès ’ jailer .
“ Your “ D ’ Artagnan .
The count did not notice the introduction , in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the House ; but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand , he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him .
And will you not torment me any more ? ” “ Never. ” Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change .
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled ; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom , drew out a paper , and held it toward Athos .
“ I , ” cried Bonacieux , “ I deceive your Eminence ! ” “ Your wife , in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe , did not go to find linen drapers. ” “ Then why did she go , just God ? ” “ She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham. ” “ Yes , ” cried Bonacieux , recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances , “ yes , that ’ s it .
“ He first kills M. de Saint-Méran , ” repeated the doctor , “ then Madame de Saint-Méran , —a double fortune to inherit. ” Villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead .
Don ’ t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me , Monsieur de Rochefort .
He wished once again to press the count ’ s hand , but his own was immovable .
The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier , so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive .

“ Monsieur Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo , as I ordered you yesterday. ” “ Yes , excellency , ” returned the steward ; “ but it was very late. ” “ Did I not tell you I wished for one ? ” replied the count , frowning .
“ I had been told , but would not credit it , that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali Pasha. ” “ It is true , nevertheless. ” “ Then , ” said Morrel , “ I understand it all , and this scene was premeditated. ” “ How so ? ” “ Yes .
“ Ah , mate , ” said Caderousse , “ you are getting on better terms with your old landlord ! ” “ Faith , yes , ” replied Andrea , whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling .

The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel , edged by a border of thick box , of many years ’ growth , and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix , our modern Rubens .
“ Never mind , Renée , ” replied the marquise , with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features ; but , however all other feelings may be withered in a woman ’ s nature , there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart , and that is the shrine of maternal love .
So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence .

“ Then , ” resumed he , “ mad , desperate , determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything , honor and happiness , my poor brother returned to Lille , and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place , surrendered himself , and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison .
“ Oh ! ” said Porthos .
“ You hear , Comminges ? ” said the queen .
my strength is failing me ; I am dying. ” The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Athos .

Yes , keen and cutting politeness .
In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house .

Milady shuddered .
Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity. ” Bertuccio bowed respectfully , and turned away , sighing heavily .
I will die here , and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens ! ’ “ ‘ You shall have no weapon left in your power. ’ “ ‘ There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it .
La Ramee sent away the guards , desiring them to drink to the duke ’ s health , and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors , put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified : “ Whenever my lord pleases. ” The prince looked at Grimaud , Grimaud looked at the clock ; it was hardly a quarter-past six .
Milady therefore continued her voyage , and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France , the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in triumph .

The Duc de Beaufort .
There were collected and piled up all Albert ’ s successive caprices , hunting-horns , bass-viols , flutes—a whole orchestra , for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing-gloves , broadswords , and single-sticks—for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , Albert de Morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy ’ s education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single-stick ; and it was here that he received Grisier , Cooks , and Charles Leboucher .

One alone is left to me , but he is one of those known , I believe , to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak. ” “ Very good , ” said the queen ; “ you and your friend are worth an army. ” “ What am I to do , madame ? ” “ Return at five o ’ clock and I will tell you ; but do not breathe to a living soul , sir , the rendezvous which I give you. ” “ No , madame. ” “ Swear it upon the cross. ” “ Madame , I have never been false to my word ; when I say I will not do a thing , I mean it. ” The queen , although astonished at this language , to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers , argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which D ’ Artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project .

“ A small vessel with an English crew , whose captain is on my side , awaits you at the mouth of Charente , at Fort La Pointe * .
He had been contented , for the convenience of the house , to lodge in the fourth story ; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof .
“ I have been wrong ; I see it .
“ Open the door ! ” cried Villefort .
Monsieur Grimaud ( he told us his name , although he does not talk much ) —Monsieur Grimaud , then , went down to the cellar , wounded as he was ; then his master , having admitted him , barricaded the door afresh , and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar. ” “ But where is Athos now ? ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
“ I do not know , for I have never had it , madame. ” “ Have you any friends ? ” “ I had three , two of whom have left Paris , to go I know not where .
There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur d ’ Arminges and beat a retreat .
let them come on !
“ There are no extravagant hopes but for fools , monsieur , and you are a man of understanding .
And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party , whose money he managed .
If your friend remains another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined man. ” “ And not more than justice , either , you ass !
You are a brave fellow. ” “ As I told you , monsieur , ” replied Planchet , “ Picards are found out by being used .
Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment , and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word .
It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady .
Dead Animosities .
Ah , then , madame , I was able for one instant to be alone with you .
He bowed politely to the baroness , familiarly to Danglars , and affectionately to Monte Cristo .
His heart beat , but not like D ’ Artagnan ’ s with a young and impatient love .
“ He resembles his mother. ” So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in .
Ali , having pointed to the apartments , held up three fingers of his right hand , and then , placing it beneath his head , shut his eyes , and feigned to sleep .
She slept as a prisoner sleeps , rocked by his first hope .
“ Revolt !
He lowered to earth his eyes , beatifically raised to Heaven , and recognized Friquet .
The former had no doubt finished his questions , for a moment later he said good-night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier .
MILADY ’ S SECRET Chapter XXXVIII .
He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I desired .
The jailer came in the evening .
One morning the gardener went to him and told him , as if to please him , that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use .
His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles , and appeared , with his grinning mouth , to be the only part of his face in which life survived .
The young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience , turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again , rummaging and rerummaging in his valise , and opening and reopening his purse ; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found , he flew , for the third time , into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine , oil , and rosemary—for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found , the host seized a spit , his wife a broom handle , and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before .
“ I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was speaking. ” “ The hand of the Lord is stretched over him , ” said Felton ; “ he will not escape the chastisement he deserves. ” Felton only expressed , with regard to the duke , the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner , the pillager , the debauchee , and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan .
let us speak frankly , ” continued Louvieres , “ and act in a straightforward manner .
Where is her stepmother ?
“ Most likely , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ I am one of his most faithful servants. ” “ It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England ? ” “ Yes ; a certain D ’ Artagnan , a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends , with the intention of going to London. ” “ Do you know him personally ? ” asked the governor .
“ Eh , give it to me ! ” said the young man .
Lead me to him. ” Jacopo pointed towards the horizon .
M. de Tréville , being informed of this by his Eminence , packed his portmanteau ; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris , it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort .
Carmela looked all around her , but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own , or those of her companions .
“ Either you are a demon , ” continued Felton , “ or the baron—my benefactor , my father—is a monster .
In this kind of game , not to kill is to let one ’ s self be killed .
“ To prepare her system to resist poison ? ” “ Yes. ” “ By accustoming her by degrees—— ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” said Noirtier , delighted to be understood .
That is why I have uttered the words for which you blame me ; that is why I have filled this whole assembly with horror .
With respect to Aramis , though having the air of having nothing secret about him , he was a young fellow made up of mysteries , answering little to questions put to him about others , and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a princess , wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor .
Villefort looked at Valentine as they said this .
Do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment , but which they can take up again instantly , if you attempt to intercept their movements. ” 50157m “ My father—I will know who my father is , ” said the obstinate youth ; “ I will perish if I must , but I _will_ know it .
“ Under any circumstances , ” he resumed , “ you are welcome , my dear friend ; you will help me to recover my spirits ; to-morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain , which is a superb tract of land , or pursue the deer in my woods , which are magnificent .
And for what kind of talent are they celebrated ?
An instant afterwards the door opened , she felt two arms encircle her , and a mouth pressed her forehead .
I have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side .
20121m “ That night a memorable event occurred , due , no doubt , to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights .
D ’ Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand , and turned up the number three ; his paleness terrified Athos , who , however , consented himself with saying , “ That ’ s a sad throw , comrade ; you will have the horses fully equipped , monsieur. ” The Englishman , quite triumphant , did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice .
The park is twenty acres—twenty , comprising kitchen-gardens and a common .
Accept this half-pistole to drink to my health. ” “ I do not drink ” —Bazin pushed away with dignity the officer ’ s hand— “ ’ tis good only for the laity. ” “ Incorruptible ! ” murmured D ’ Artagnan ; “ I am unlucky ; ” and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy , and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him .
Life itself may be resolved into three words : _Erat , est , fuit_. ” “ Which means— ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to suspect the truth .
I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about .
He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis , and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress .
Both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance .
love ! _ “ Pardon for what ? ” asked she .
Felton , in his rapid walk , reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I. and Charles I. , furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans .
He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea ; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry .
Shall further inquiries be made ?
The conditions are favorable ; what else was opera invented for ? ” “ No , thank you .
0289m Chapter 23 .
On the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father , the servants all fled with muttered imprecations ; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages , then there was a rush in the court , afterwards all was still ; they had , one and all , deserted the accursed house .
Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir , containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch .
He described to him his interview with the cardinal , and said , for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket , “ You , our friend , our intelligence , our invisible protector , accept this commission .
Upon which the stranger asked his name , and learning that it was Porthos , and not D ’ Artagnan , he assisted him to rise , brought him back to the hôtel , mounted his horse , and disappeared. ” “ So it was with Monsieur d ’ Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel ? ” “ It appears so. ” “ And do you know what has become of him ? ” “ No , I never saw him until that moment , and have not seen him since. ” “ Very well ; I know all that I wish to know .
Years have elapsed , many events have happened , alas !
She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger , and Maximilian began to laugh .
I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédès. ” “ You have had too much already , drunkard , ” said Danglars ; “ and if you continue , you will be compelled to sleep here , because unable to stand on your legs. ” “ I ? ” said Caderousse , rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man , “ I can ’ t keep on my legs ?
“ But will that not excite suspicion , sir ? ” asked the queen .
Besides , he had long known the prince , whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time .
A TERRIBLE VISION The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript , his cheek upon his hand , and looked intently at the young man for a moment .
He hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings , and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph headed _We hear from Yanina._ “ Very good , ” observed Danglars , after having read the paragraph ; “ here is a little article on Colonel Fernand , which , if I am not mistaken , would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary. ” At the same moment , that is , at nine o ’ clock in the morning , Albert de Morcerf , dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin , might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristo ’ s house in the Champs-Élysées .
How much do you want ? ” “ All you have in gold. ” “ I have five hundred pistoles , or thereabouts. ” “ I have as much .
If you will help me to drag myself from under my horse I hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey. ” Monsieur d ’ Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse .
The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds , to which Porthos escorted his friend .
In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur d ’ Herblay our crime would be confirmed .
She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages .
His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen , and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips ; the queen did not wear her diamond studs .
“ How , can not be ?
I sank on my knees , my hands clasped round one of the bedposts ; then I felt that I was lost. ” Felton became frightfully pale , and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body .
“ Well , this is what you have to say , ” said D ’ Artagnan : “ _My Lord , your sister-in-law is an infamous woman , who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth ; but she could not marry your brother , being already married in France , and having been_— ” D ’ Artagnan stopped , as if seeking for the word , and looked at Athos .
Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked .
You will come off splendidly at those two exercises ; but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abbé .
Besides , as M. de Tréville saw the queen almost daily , he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman , whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress .
Did I know poor dear Edmond ?
Grimaud ’ s agitation , his pallor , the sweat which covered his face , the dust which soiled his clothes , all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news .
End of the Port Wine Mystery .
“ You pretend not to know , —because government was not rich enough. ” “ Ah , pardon me , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ I have heard of these things every day during the last eight years , and I can not understand them yet. ” “ You will , by and by , ” said Debray .
d ’ Artagnan , of the king ’ s Guards , company Dessessart , is expected at the Palais-Cardinal this evening , at eight o ’ clock .
“ Do you say , ” resumed D ’ Artagnan , “ that you suspect that impertinent gentleman ? ” “ I tell you I am sure of it , ” continued the host .
“ On the other bank , ” replied the executioner .
“ Nay , I know not ; some evidence required from us , perhaps. ” “ May it not be about that cursed affair ? ” asked Aramis , “ in which case I do not greatly care to go , for it will be to pocket a lecture ; and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them myself. ” “ If it were so , ” answered Athos , “ we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter , for he would come in for his share ; he was one of us. ” “ You ’ re right ; yes , let us go. ” On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first ; indeed , there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate .
“ You speak first. ” “ Oh , no .
Julie threw herself into his arms .
M. Danglars no longer had a daughter .
Is she French ? ” “ No ; a Venetian. ” “ And her name is—— ” “ Countess G——. ” “ Ah , I know her by name ! ” exclaimed Albert ; “ she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty .
“ He seems besotted , ” said Danglars , pushing Caderousse with his knee .
At that moment Mme .
Bonacieux was the very life of D ’ Artagnan .
On the entrance of the new-comers , their eyes glanced from father to son , and then , naturally enough , rested on the latter , whom they began criticising .
For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man , that dear Marie ; I know only one other woman who can do it as well .
Mercédès might have been a queen , sir , if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent .
We will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the point of having someone assassinated , and beg him not to lose sight of her .
Here it would be dangerous ; the house may be watched .
Have you seen him lately ? ” “ He sent for me to-day. ” “ Really !
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .
I told you Villefort was ambitious , and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything , even his father. ” “ Then , sire , may I present him ? ” “ This instant , duke !
5 , where Lord Wilmore lived .
here ? ” “ Yes , here , in this convent , my dear fellow .
Milady uttered a stifled groan .
“ Well ? ” said the landlord .
“ Come , come , ” murmured D ’ Artagnan , “ Rochefort has kept his promise , but where in the devil is he ? ” And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses , but there was no sign of Rochefort .
I stand in need of being taught and consoled. ” “ Consoled for what ? ” “ For my misfortune. ” “ Your misfortune is laughable , ” said Athos , shrugging his shoulders ; “ I should like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a real tale of love ! ” “ Which has happened to you ? ” “ Or one of my friends , what matters ? ” “ Tell it , Athos , tell it. ” “ Better if I drink. ” “ Drink and relate , then. ” “ Not a bad idea ! ” said Athos , emptying and refilling his glass .
“ Ah , I ’ m ready to do what you will , ” cried Porthos ; “ even to swear by Mahomet .
You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined ; but the _mazzolata_ still remains , which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time , and even the second , while the other , as you must know , is very simple .
As for Aramis , of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character—a character which , like that of his companions , we shall be able to follow in its development—his lackey was called Bazin .
Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on .
Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen ; a Don Quixote without his corselet , without his coat of mail , without his cuisses ; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet , the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure ; face long and brown ; high cheek bones , a sign of sagacity ; the maxillary muscles enormously developed , an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected , even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather ; the eye open and intelligent ; the nose hooked , but finely chiseled .
More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service .
Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_ , and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello .
The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart .
“ Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel , in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu , tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood , to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to Buckingham. ” Anne arose , full of majesty , and as if touched by a spring , and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful : “ You are insulting me ! ” she said .
“ These are , doubtless , your family arms ?
What was it then ?
Don ’ t deny it ; you were recognized , and the cardinal named you .
Monsieur d ’ Herblay , ” she added , turning toward Aramis , “ will you be my servant once more this evening ? ” “ How can you doubt it ? ” replied Aramis ; “ this evening , to-morrow , always ; command me. ” “ I will , then .
Ah !
Pray reflect a little .
“ At what hour ? ” inquired a turnkey .
“ Well , ” said Athos , when Aramis and he were in the boat again , “ are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin ? ” “ You are wisdom incarnate , Athos , ” Aramis replied .
“ Yes , it was a prison , for I tried in vain to get out of it .
Good luck to you. ” The young sailor jumped into the skiff , and sat down in the stern sheets , with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière .
“ Devil take these Puritans , ” said Mazarin aside ; “ they are carved from granite. ” Then he added aloud , “ But you have relations left you ? ” “ I have one remaining .
The name is wanting in this commission ; you can write it yourself. ” D ’ Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it ; it was a lieutenant ’ s commission in the Musketeers .
D ’ Artagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze , when the baron , after walking scarcely more than twenty paces , returned—stood still—struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed : “ I recollect ! ” “ What ? ” inquired D ’ Artagnan .
Mazarin pretended to laugh .
“ Officer ! ” cried Grimaud .
I sleep no longer , monsieur .
“ Well , then , we will go into Paris .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ up to this time—and it is now more than four-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from my father , who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years—never has anything bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored. ” “ I know that , ” replied the Englishman .
D ’ Avrigny accosted the priest .
For mercy ’ s sake , then , what would you call Robespierre ?
But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_ ? —the gigantic bellows , the monstrous extinguishers , the superhuman fans .
“ To be sure ; besides , every millionaire is as noble as a bastard—that is , he can be. ” “ Do not say that , Debray , ” returned Beauchamp , laughing , “ for here is Château-Renaud , who , to cure you of your mania for paradoxes , will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban , his ancestor , through your body. ” “ He will sully it then , ” returned Lucien ; “ for I am low—very low. ” “ Oh , heavens , ” cried Beauchamp , “ the minister quotes Béranger , what shall we come to next ? ” “ M .
The sun , red and flaming , was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean .
He stooped down , picked up the bag of money , and placed it between his teeth .
The bandage fell from his eyes , and he understood the joke , which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before .

Laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep .
For him those ten minutes were very long .
Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him .
“ I comprehend now. ” “ You comprehend ? ” said Porthos .
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary , compressed , marked up , nonproprietary or proprietary form , including any word processing or hypertext form .
Workmen were immediately called in , and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house .
“ Why are the glass and decanter empty ? ” asked he ; “ Valentine said she only drank half the glassful. ” The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes .
The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort , and refreshed his memory .
“ From the appearance of the stone , ” he continued , “ a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years .
“ And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced ? ” “ By the countess ’ s visiting the Colosseum , as we did last night , by moonlight , and nearly alone. ” “ You were with her , then ? ” “ I was. ” “ And what did you say to her ? ” “ Oh , we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument ! ” “ Upon my word , ” cried Albert , “ you must have been a very entertaining companion alone , or all but alone , with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum , and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead !
The count wished to speak , but a gush of blood stifled him .
In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my search .
“ An opportunity will come , ” replied Rochefort .
That was not the appointed hour .
It may , therefore , be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum , that wonder of all ages , which Martial thus eulogizes : “ Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids , and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us ; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars , and the many voices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument. ” As for Albert and Franz , they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants ; and , indeed , it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage , as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands .
I will be with you directly. ” The young men rose and returned into the salon , while the count , again apologizing , left by another door .
Now , as I am not egotistical , we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her. ’ “ ‘ You have determined , then , to abandon her to the common law ? ’ said Carlini .
Why didn ’ t they search more vigilantly ?
But that is not all .
CONCLUSION EPILOGUE AUTHOR ’ S PREFACE In which it is proved that , notwithstanding their names ’ ending in _os_ and _is_ , the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them .
A child encumbers a fugitive ; perhaps , on perceiving it was still alive , he had thrown it into the river. ” “ Impossible ! ” cried Madame Danglars : “ a man may murder another out of revenge , but he would not deliberately drown a child. ” “ Perhaps , ” continued Villefort , “ he had put it in the foundling hospital. ” “ Oh , yes , yes , ” cried the baroness ; “ my child is there ! ” “ I ran to the hospital , and learned that the same night—the night of the 20th of September—a child had been brought there , wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin , purposely torn in half .
To form the slightest idea of his feelings , one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven .
D ’ Artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question .
We are not in the time of Malatesta and Castruccio Castracani .
Albert rose to return to his place .
This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city .
He was not rich , although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb , and I heard the phrase very often , ‘ As rich as a Spada. ’ But he , like public rumor , lived on this reputation for wealth ; his palace was my paradise .
As soon as we are married , he shall come and live with us , instead of one child , he shall have two .
I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here , close to this reservoir , and which some one has trampled upon this morning .
“ My dear D ’ Artagnan , ” said Aramis , “ don ’ t be too angry with me , I beg .
“ And now , Raoul , ” said he , “ you are launched ; you have dukes for friends , a marshal of France for godfather , a prince of the blood as commander , and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens ; it is not so bad for a novice. ” “ Oh sir , ” said Raoul , suddenly , “ you recall something , which , in my haste to relate my exploits , I had forgotten ; it is that there was with Her Majesty the Queen of England , a gentleman who , when I pronounced your name , uttered a cry of surprise and joy ; he said he was a friend of yours , asked your address , and is coming to see you. ” “ What is his name ? ” “ I did not venture to ask , sir ; he spoke elegantly , although I thought from his accent he was an Englishman. ” “ Ah ! ” said Athos , leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be .
“ Kitty , ” said he , “ I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like ; don ’ t let that disturb you. ” And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry .
“ Villefort , ” she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner .
“ Nothing ! ” replied Grimaud .
Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel ? ” “ Dear , good Renée , ” whispered Villefort , as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker .
So , then , they have paid my ransom ? ” “ No , your excellency. ” “ Well , then , how am I free ? ” “ A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you. ” “ Come hither ? ” “ Yes , hither. ” “ Really ?
Confidence and love made him a giant .
Then d ’ Avrigny spoke .
We request you , then , if you really have business here , to wait till we have finished our repast , or to come again a short time hence ; unless , which would be far better , you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels , and come and drink with us to the health of the King of France. ” “ Take care , Athos ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ don ’ t you see they are aiming ? ” “ Yes , yes , ” said Athos ; “ but they are only civilians—very bad marksmen , who will be sure not to hit me. ” In fact , at the same instant four shots were fired , and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos , but not one touched him .
Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative .
“ Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket ? ” asked the duke .
De Tréville knows him and esteems him very highly , and De Tréville , as you know , is one of the queen ’ s greatest friends .
His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter .
The young girl did not speak ; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father ’ s breast .
“ Oh , yes , certainly , ” said the count ; “ uniform , cross , knee-breeches. ” “ And how shall I be dressed ? ” demanded Andrea .
So much the worse , so much the worse—_diavolo ! _ as they say in my country. ” “ Reverend sir , I am impelled—— ” “ Every criminal says the same thing. ” “ Poverty—— ” “ Pshaw ! ” said Busoni disdainfully ; “ poverty may make a man beg , steal a loaf of bread at a baker ’ s door , but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited .
He must have written to him .
I knew the horse he rode ; it belonged to the butcher , who lets it out now and then to M. Bazin .
“ Your excellency , ” he said , “ the master of the Hôtel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcerf. ” “ A letter from the viscount ! ” exclaimed Franz .
“ I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct ; you have spared me till now , but since you speak of it , once for all , I tell you—— ” “ Madame , I do not ask you to tell me , ” said Mazarin , astounded by this returning courage .
Franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle .
At the end of the piece Étienne entered , and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage , and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits .
As was his custom , D ’ Artagnan presented himself at Milady ’ s at about nine o ’ clock .
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman ; and her looks , fixed on the future , beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal , whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair .
I say two , because in such circumstances , Monsieur du Vallon , who is rich , always gives me his prisoners. ” Mordaunt , completely deceived by the wordy civility of D ’ Artagnan , smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him , and said : “ I shall have the order signed directly , sir , and with it two thousand pistoles ; meanwhile , let me take these men away. ” “ No , ” replied D ’ Artagnan ; “ what signifies a delay of half an hour ?
Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command ?
We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain .
Pray , was Danglars acquainted with Fernand ? ” “ No—yes , he was .
But fortunately this was not the case , and the governor left him , convinced that the poor madman , for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection , was only troubled with a slight indisposition .
On his side D ’ Artagnan became more cautious also .
“ Non siete Spagnuolo , ” he said ; “ non siete Tedesco ; siete Italiano. ” The prisoner started and bit his lips .
Then he went into the stable ; he found the five horses saddled , his own amongst the rest .
The very animals we were speaking of , harnessed to the count ’ s carriage ! ” “ My dappled grays ? ” demanded the baroness , springing to the window .
what is yonder ? ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
He is called Bragelonne .
He remained , therefore , mute and motionless , hardly venturing to breathe .
“ I wager anything , ” said Albert , interrupting her , “ that I know what you were about to say. ” “ Well , what is it ? ” “ If I guess rightly , will you confess it ? ” “ Yes. ” “ On your honor ? ” “ On my honor. ” “ You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived , or was expected. ” “ Not at all .
It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined. ” “ Oh !

Correcting himself immediately , he said , “ Excuse me , sir ; hope alone makes me almost mad , —what will not reality do ? ” “ But , ” said Danglars , who , on his part , did not perceive how soon the conversation , which was at first disinterested , was turning to a business transaction , “ there is , doubtless , a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you ? ” “ Which ? ” asked the young man .

First , M. and Madame de Saint-Méran incurred his displeasure , so he poured out three drops of his elixir—three drops were sufficient ; then followed Barrois , the old servant of M. Noirtier , who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch—he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir ; the same happened to Valentine , of whom he was jealous ; he gave her the same dose as the others , and all was over for her as well as the rest. ” “ Why , what nonsense are you telling us ? ” said Château-Renaud .

How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians ? ” “ My good friend , as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence , it would ill become me to search too closely into its source ; therefore , instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws , you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection ; not altogether for preserving my life , for my own idea was that it never was in much danger , but certainly for saving me 4,000 piastres , which , being translated , means neither more nor less than 24,000 livres of our money—a sum at which , most assuredly , I should never have been estimated in France , proving most indisputably , ” added Albert with a laugh , “ that no prophet is honored in his own country. ” “ Talking of countries , ” replied Franz , “ of what country is the count , what is his native tongue , whence does he derive his immense fortune , and what were those events of his early life—a life as marvellous as unknown—that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy ?

Father and Son M. Noirtier—for it was , indeed , he who entered—looked after the servant until the door was closed , and then , fearing , no doubt , that he might be overheard in the antechamber , he opened the door again , nor was the precaution useless , as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain , who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents .

believe me—guilty as I was—oh , yes , I , too , have suffered much ! ” “ Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence ? ” cried Monte Cristo , thrusting his hands into his hair ; “ have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival , while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon ? ” “ No , ” interrupted Mercédès , “ but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son. ” Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish , with an accent of such intense despair , that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob .
D ’ Artagnan , in particular , had a perpetual buzzing in his ears , which Porthos explained thus : “ A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere. ” At length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third , in the night .

“ Madame , ” replied Villefort , with a mournful smile , “ I have already had the honor to observe that my father has—at least , I hope so—abjured his past errors , and that he is , at the present moment , a firm and zealous friend to religion and order—a better royalist , possibly , than his son ; for he has to atone for past dereliction , while I have no other impulse than warm , decided preference and conviction. ” Having made this well-turned speech , Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory , much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court .

The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand , in whom the grand vizier , Ali Tepelini , had reposed the greatest confidence. ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ what do you see in that to annoy you ? ” “ What do I see in it ? ” “ Yes ; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer ? ” “ It signifies to my father , the Count of Morcerf , whose Christian name is Fernand ! ” “ Did your father serve under Ali Pasha ? ” “ Yes ; that is to say , he fought for the independence of the Greeks , and hence arises the calumny. ” “ Oh , my dear viscount , do talk reason ! ” “ I do not desire to do otherwise. ” “ Now , just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person ?

Let him be interred in holy ground .
They reached the building , ornamented with magnificent fruits , which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun , so frequently absent in our climate .
Villefort understood the king ’ s intent .
He caused me to be instructed , gave me masters , and when I was thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud. ” “ Of whom I bought her , ” said Monte Cristo , “ as I told you , Albert , with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills. ” “ Oh , you are good , you are great , my lord ! ” said Haydée , kissing the count ’ s hand , “ and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master ! ” Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard .

The curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_ , from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary , are all engaged on the stage at the same time ; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude , or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of volition , influenced the moving mass .

This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or Anthony. ” At this moment a fresh visitor entered , and , according to custom , Franz gave up his seat to him .

At the end of two hundred years the documents were found , and they thought of bringing up the jars .

“ Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride .
No distraction could come to his aid ; his energetic spirit , that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past , was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage .

He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Musée , but , strange to say , he was not there when I returned. ” “ Monsieur Morrel ! ” exclaimed a voice on the stairs ; “ Monsieur Morrel ! ” “ It is his voice ! ” said Julie .

Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner .
The exclamations , the insults addressed to Benedetto , who remained perfectly unconcerned , the energetic gestures , the movement of the gendarmes , the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this lasted five minutes , before the door-keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence .

“ The scheme goes forward , it seems. ” “ On wheels , dear friend. ” “ Good !
the deuce it is ; unlucky , for my stomach is getting more and more upset. ” “ Locked ! ” repeated Mousqueton .
The baron entered slowly , sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer .

“ Well , ” said the banker to his daughter , “ are we then all to be excluded ? ” He then led the young man into the study , and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after Andrea , so that from the place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything ; but as the banker had accompanied Andrea , Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice of it .

Athos took the letter from the hands of D ’ Artagnan , approached the lamp , set fire to the paper , and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder .

D ’ Artagnan , who had loved him so tenderly , loved him still , although a Mazarinist .
Will you be ambassador , Albert ?
Madame de Saint-Méran A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort .

“ I hate the English—they are coarse , like every nation that swills beer. ” “ Would it be better to remain here , ” said Athos , “ and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort ?
“ Yes , with Frenchmen , and Frenchmen like you. ” “ And Monsieur du Vallon , ” added the other .
Ah !
I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear , such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me , it would change the appearance of things. ” “ And I , my dear Aramis , ” quietly replied Athos , “ I think it would only change Monsieur de Retz ’ s appearance .
Those who took me from my father , and who always intended , sooner or later , to sell me again to my original proprietor , as they have now done , calculated that , in order to make the most of their bargain , it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth , and even to increase the value , if possible .
“ You are Monsieur d ’ Artagnan. ” “ You see , monsieur , that you say it again. ” “ But I tell you , Monsieur Commissary , ” cried Bonacieux , in his turn , “ there is not the least doubt about the matter .

“ They will promise everything for the sake of the money , and on the road fear will prevent them from acting .
“ What a question !
Morrel was mad .
my lord—escape !
Stop ! ” “ Yes , doubtless , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head , and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair , “ yes , doubtless there is one. ” “ There certainly is one , ” said M. de Tréville , who had a tincture of literature , “ and Monsieur de Benserade was quoting it to me the other day .

“ I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere , ” replied the cardinal , bowing to Athos .
“ It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you ? ” “ Oh , your excellency ! ” exclaimed Baptistin eagerly .
“ They don ’ t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four. ” “ Yes , but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind ; he has a lieutenant , and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt. ” This time the musketeers did more than shudder—they almost cried out .
On arriving there , with an air as majestic as that of an emperor , he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow .

“ And this _carte blanche_ , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ this _carte blanche_ , does it remain in her hands ? ” “ No , it passed into mine ; I will not say without trouble , for if I did I should tell a lie. ” “ My dear Athos , I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my life. ” “ Then it was to go to her that you left us ? ” said Aramis .
Really , Captain Groslow , you are too much in fortune ’ s way .
Employ them , if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind. ” “ Felton has not told him , ” said Milady to herself .

A man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty-three .
“ Oh !
It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit , for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek. ” “ It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light. ” “ No , Valentine , I assure you such is not the case .
“ Well , ” said he , filling the glasses , “ let us drink to Captain Edmond Dantès , husband of the beautiful Catalane ! ” Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand , and swallowed the contents at a gulp .
The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes .
“ Guilty ?
We will send my brother ’ s servant back to Béthune , whom , as I told you , we can trust .
“ One ! ” said the grave-diggers , “ two !
But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage ? ” “ I do not think that is the case. ” “ However it may be , Valentine , you must not be alarmed .
An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect , not of a downy couch , but of a tomb .
Oh , what a detestable crew they are , these mercenary speculators ! ” “ Madame , ” replied Danglars , “ the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you ; they were scarcely four years old , and they made me extremely uneasy on your account. ” “ Nonsense , ” retorted the baroness ; “ you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject , because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris .
“ That ’ s well .
“ It is long since we have had a good dinner ; and I , for my part , have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening , and shall not be sorry , I confess , to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burgundy. ” “ Agreed , as to the old Burgundy ; I have no objection to that , ” said Aramis , from whom the letter and the gold had removed , as by magic , his ideas of conversion .
Oh , signora , if I could but speak Greek , your conversation , added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me , would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget. ” “ I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you , sir , ” said Haydée quietly ; “ and if you like what is Eastern , I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here. ” “ On what subject shall I converse with her ? ” said Albert , in a low tone to Monte Cristo .
“ Oh , for pity ’ s sake ! ” “ You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel , one of my friends , had not stopped him. ” “ Listen to me , my son has also guessed who you are , —he attributes his father ’ s misfortunes to you. ” “ Madame , you are mistaken , they are not misfortunes , —it is a punishment .
At all events , she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother-in-law , with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily , rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy .
“ Well , ” said he , extending his hand to Monte Cristo , “ I suppose you have come to sympathize with me , for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house .
Madame de Villefort rose , Monte Cristo did the same , and the rest followed their example .
Monte Cristo arose and approached her , took her hand , and said to her in Romaic : “ Calm yourself , my dear child , and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors. ” “ It is a frightful story , count , ” said Albert , terrified at the paleness of Haydée ’ s countenance , “ and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request. ” “ Oh , it is nothing , ” said Monte Cristo .
He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen , as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms , the beautiful Madame de Longueville .
Only—the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were consumed .
Oh , how charitable , kind , and good you are ; you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage. ” “ You are wrong , Morrel ; I was really happy. ” “ Then you forget me , so much the better. ” “ How so ? ” “ Yes ; for as the gladiator said to the emperor , when he entered the arena , ‘ He who is about to die salutes you. ’ ” “ Then you are not consoled ? ” asked the count , surprised .
Athos collected himself , and in proportion as he did so , D ’ Artagnan saw that he became pale .
“ To what country ? ” demanded Porthos .

In the first place , let us agree that the word poison does not exist , because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons , which become , according as they are employed , most salutary remedies. ” “ What , then , is it ? ” “ A skilful preparation of my friend ’ s the worthy Abbé Adelmonte , who taught me the use of it. ” “ Oh , ” observed Madame de Villefort , “ it must be an admirable anti-spasmodic. ” “ Perfect , madame , as you have seen , ” replied the count ; “ and I frequently make use of it—with all possible prudence though , be it observed , ” he added with a smile of intelligence .
“ Adieu , Raoul , ” said the count ; “ adieu , my dearest boy ! ” “ Adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector. ” Athos waved his hand—he dared not trust himself to speak : and Raoul went away , his head uncovered .
“ You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors , monsieur , ” said he ; “ it is a handsome uniform. ” No one could have said what caused the count ’ s voice to vibrate so deeply , and what made his eye flash , which was in general so clear , lustrous , and limpid when he pleased .
He started when he saw Renée , for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dantès .
Seeing D ’ Artagnan about to leave her , Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes .
“ These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous , ” observed D ’ Artagnan to Porthos and went on his way .
But as regards your wish to visit our fine city , my dear count , I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please. ” “ Then it is settled , ” said the count , “ and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated. ” Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo , and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely , hoping to read something of his purpose in his face , but his countenance was inscrutable especially when , as in the present case , it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile .
“ Yes ; and as I am just now excessively annoyed , I shall go from home .
Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman .
M. d ’ Avrigny smiled sadly .
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS , THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF ARAMIS D ’ Artagnan , in a state of fury , crossed the antechamber at three bounds , and was darting toward the stairs , which he reckoned upon descending four at a time , when , in his heedless course , he ran head foremost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de Tréville ’ s private rooms , and striking his shoulder violently , made him utter a cry , or rather a howl .
“ I am called , ” said Andrea .
Good , it is by my side !
“ Patrick , ” said the duke , “ bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept. ” Patrick brought the object desired , which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen .
“ And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel ? ” “ I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it .
“ Sign the treaty , then , monseigneur , ” said Aramis .
The reason for so publicly announcing all this is , that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits , and , above all , beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere repentance. ” “ And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful , are they ? ” asked Franz somewhat incredulously .
Do you understand ? ” “ That ’ s no doubt very fine , ” said Porthos ; “ but deuce take me if I understand at all. ” “ Porthos , my friend , you know I am descended on the father ’ s side from the Prophets and on the mother ’ s from the Sybils , and that I only speak in parables and riddles .
A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet , and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was , as sportsmen would say , keeping his hand in .
“ Well , come ; set to. ” “ Ah , sir , you are going to save my life a second time ! ” cried Planchet .
“ Farewell , till the next time we meet , ” cried Chatillon , and he set off , full gallop .

Thanks to the sale of his horse , he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de Tréville possessed at the commencement of his .
On this conviction I allow her to speculate , she having her bank and her stockbroker ; she speculated and lost .
Now , as D ’ Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights , it was upon him that all the felicitations fell , which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis abandoned to him , not only as good comrades , but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his .
“ Come , sir , do not keep me starving here any longer , but tell me what they want. ” “ Nay , your excellency , it is you who should tell us what you want .
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated ; the Musketeers hastening to the hôtel of M. de Tréville , the Guards to that of M. Dessessart .
“ My worthy Cocles , ” said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe , “ do you remain in the antechamber .
But really—No matter , go on. ” “ The journey of that day had been long and wearing ; it was a cold day , the eleventh of October , there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive .
“ What do you prescribe , doctor ? ” demanded Villefort .
“ —of intrigues and secrets of state , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , complying with the recommendation .
Morrel had thought of Danglars , who was now immensely rich , and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former days , since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker , with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth .
When crime has been committed , and God , doubtless in anger , turns away his face , it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice. ” 40122m “ Have mercy on my child , sir , ” murmured Villefort .
“ Now , my friends , ” said Athos , “ finish them at a blow .
We listen , Monsieur Athos. ” “ Yes , the wager ! ” said the light-horseman .
The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day , but he had reckoned without his guest .
I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange ; I met Monsieur Dujart in England ; I know Monsieur de Tréville. ” “ Monsieur de Tréville ! ” exclaimed the novice , “ do you know Monsieur de Tréville ? ” “ Yes , perfectly well—intimately even. ” “ The captain of the king ’ s Musketeers ? ” “ The captain of the king ’ s Musketeers. ” “ Why , then , only see ! ” cried the novice ; “ we shall soon be well acquainted , almost friends .
“ You see , ” said Lord de Winter , presenting D ’ Artagnan to his sister , “ a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands , and who has not abused his advantage , although we have been twice enemies , although it was I who insulted him , and although I am an Englishman .
1.E.9 .
That will be four killed .
He came languidly , placing himself in a good situation to see all the details .
It was then , especially while conversing with Madame Danglars , and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation , that the count noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti ’ s solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of manifesting his admiration .
Good !
Poor things !
I shall go and die by his side. ” “ Madame , madame , ” exclaimed De Winter , “ your majesty abandons yourself to despair ; and yet , perhaps , there still remains some hope. ” “ No friends left , my lord ; no other friends left in the wide world but yourself !
Your swords are in the corner ; do not forget them , they are in many circumstances very useful ; there is Porthos ’ s purse , too. ” He put it into his pocket .
The game at tennis , which , upon a sign from Grimaud , Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play , began in the afternoon .
In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two , two bottles of wine sealed , the one with green , the other with yellow , a supply of brandy in a decanter , and a measure of fruit in a cabbage-leaf , cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate .
After giving some directions to Ali , who stood in the lobby , the count took Albert ’ s arm .
But all this will come to an end , Tréville , will come to an end .
Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room , where there were several people .
Go ! ” The count signified his intention of dining alone , and that no one but Ali should attend him .
Speak freely .
Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height , of a haughty , proud mien ; with piercing eyes , a large brow , and a thin face , which was made still longer by a _royal_ ( or _imperial_ , as it is now called ) , surmounted by a pair of mustaches .
“ It concerns me much , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ since you can not marry madame without my consent and since—— ” “ And since ? ” asked the Swiss .
“ Then the diamond is safe ? ” said he , timidly .
I call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one ’ s hand , such as mines , lands , and funded property , in such states as France , Austria , and England , provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions ; I call those second-rate fortunes , that are gained by manufacturing enterprises , joint-stock companies , viceroyalties , and principalities , not drawing more than 1,500,000 francs , the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions ; finally , I call those third-rate fortunes , which are composed of a fluctuating capital , dependent upon the will of others , or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes , such as banks , speculations of the day—in fact , all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances , the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions .
“ Yes. ” “ And you will protect us , who are your children , against the will of my father ? ” Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel , as if to say , “ perhaps I may. ” Maximilian understood him .
“ Thanks , D ’ Artagnan , thanks ! ” cried Aramis , almost in a state of delirium .
Then you must not pay us ; we can scud , like the _Pharaon_ , under bare poles. ” “ Enough , enough ! ” cried Morrel , almost overpowered ; “ leave me , I pray you ; we shall meet again in a happier time .
“ On the contrary , I think they are poor , sir. ” “ They are friends of yours , then ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” exclaimed Mordaunt , “ they are friends , dear friends of mine , and I would lay down my life for them. ” “ Very well , Mordaunt , ” exclaimed Cromwell , pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more ; “ I will give them to you ; I will not even ask who they are ; do as you like with them. ” “ Thank you , sir ! ” exclaimed Mordaunt , “ thank you ; my life is always at your service , and should I lose it I should still owe you something ; thank you ; you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services. ” He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell , and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general , who did not like this almost kingly homage , he took his hand and kissed it .
“ To him who is called the Comte de la Fere. ” “ It is I , ” said Athos , “ and what is the name of the person ? ” “ Grimaud. ” “ Ah ! ” exclaimed Athos , turning pale .
Some of these boats were dark and mysterious , others noisy and lighted up with torches .
Political judgments are generally vain formalities , for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation .
de Chevreuse had been in Paris , but still further , that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a _cabal ; _ when he affirmed that he , the cardinal , was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue ; that at the moment of arresting in the very act , with all the proofs about her , the queen ’ s emissary to the exiled duchess , a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently , by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law , charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king—Louis XIII .

Midnight struck .
The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin .
Sire , go , leave France to its real master , to him who acquired it , not by purchase , but by right of conquest ; go , sire , not that you incur any risk , for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy , but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcola , Marengo , Austerlitz. ’ Tell him this , Gérard ; or , rather , tell him nothing .

“ Gentlemen , ” said Andrea , commanding silence by his voice and manner ; “ I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said. ” “ But , ” said the irritated president , “ you called yourself Benedetto , declared yourself an orphan , and claimed Corsica as your country. ” “ I said anything I pleased , in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be withheld , which otherwise would certainly have been the case .

Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion. ” He cast his eyes again on the letter .
D ’ Artagnan made his way through the crowd , advanced toward the host , and pronounced the word “ Forward ! ” The host instantly made him a sign to follow , went out with him by a door which opened into a yard , led him to the stable , where a saddled horse awaited him , and asked him if he stood in need of anything else .

However , scarcely was the imperial power established—that is , scarcely had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers , —he found on the table there Louis XVIII. ’ s half-filled snuff-box , —scarcely had this occurred when Marseilles began , in spite of the authorities , to rekindle the flames of civil war , always smouldering in the south , and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad .

“ It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he referred to King Mithridates , ” continued the count , “ and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him , for your son is really advanced for his years. ” “ The fact is , count , ” answered the mother , agreeably flattered , “ he has great aptitude , and learns all that is set before him .
They re-entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles ; and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois , they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud .
Ah !
Sheathe , then , if you please , and follow us. ” “ Monsieur , ” said Aramis , parodying Jussac , “ it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves ; but unfortunately the thing is impossible—Monsieur de Tréville has forbidden it .
If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel , he was not mistaken—Maximilian started as if he had been electrified .
And wherefore should they do so ?

However , she offered the cardinal Laporte ’ s place , which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other .
He glanced around , in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn , and seemed to fall easily on a topic .
At these words he took up a silver bell , and rang it ; the officer entered .
“ Yes , admirable !
Perhaps I turned pale and trembled , but certainly I smiled ; and five minutes after I left , without having heard one word that had passed. ” “ Poor Maximilian ! ” murmured Valentine .
“ Meanwhile , madame , if you really suffer , ” said Felton , “ a physician shall be sent for ; and if you deceive us—well , it will be the worse for you .
Albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume .

As she told the queen , she had not seen her husband since his liberation ; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal—a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the Comte de Rochefort , who had become the best friend of Bonacieux , and had persuaded him , without much trouble , that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife , but that it was only a political precaution .
I will not miss you. ” “ If I give you time ! ” cried the duke , spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword .
It was not poverty which had broken her spirit ; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome .

The Return .
The latter put his hand to his sword , and said , with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death : “ Would you assassinate me , sir ?

Milady let her head sink between her two hands , and tried to recall her ideas , whirling in a mortal vertigo .
Caderousse , who had raised himself on his knees , and stretched out his arm , tried to draw back , then clasping his hands , and raising them with a desperate effort , “ Oh , my God , my God ! ” said he , “ pardon me for having denied thee ; thou dost exist , thou art indeed man ’ s father in heaven , and his judge on earth .
First , you purchase a house at Auteuil—this house is the one where I have committed an assassination ; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended ; you stop at the spot where he received the blow ; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child .
All without had heard , as we have said , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis called , and had guessed , from M. de Tréville ’ s tone of voice , that he was very angry about something .

A VISION Chapter XL .
Except the knowledge of blazons , that enables me to decipher them , I am very ignorant of heraldry—I , a count of a fresh creation , fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery of St. Stephen , and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been told that when you travel much it is necessary .
I feel easy , ” replied Porthos .
He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa , where he was waiting , as he said , for his outfit to come and find him .
In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp .
Some of the men moved toward them .
He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood .
“ What , monsieur ? ” “ I have a miraculous balsam for wounds—a balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you ; and at the end of three days , when you would be cured—well , sir , it would still do me a great honor to be your man. ” D ’ Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy , without throwing the least doubt upon his courage .
He had friends , then , after five years in prison ?
‘ Oh , I never make matches , my dear prince , it is my settled principle. ’ ” Andrea bit his lips .
I only ask you one favor ; and if you grant it me , I will bless you in this world and in the next. ” “ Speak to the master , madame , ” said Felton ; “ happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing .

“ How , madame ! ” said the valet , “ in the same carriage as your majesties ? ” “ It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening , but of the king ’ s safety .
“ Adieu , madame , ” replied the king ’ s attorney , as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door .

“ Will this promise be fulfilled , M. Noirtier ? ” asked Morrel , while d ’ Avrigny looked inquiringly .
At this moment he will have left Elba , to go whither I know not , but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples , or on the coast of Tuscany , or perhaps on the shores of France .
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration .
Great God , she is losing her senses ! ” While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice , Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water ; but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of Athos , who , standing before the table , his hair rising from his head , his eyes fixed in stupor , was looking at one of the glasses , and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt .
That ’ s well madame ; and there is an old proverb that says , ‘ Traveling trains youth. ’ My faith !
“ I am , at least , fearful of it .
“ I , my lord ? ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ why should I ? ” “ Because you shrug your shoulders. ” “ It is a way I have of speaking to myself .
“ Pronounce one single word , ” muttered D ’ Artagnan , “ and you are a dead man. ” The coachman perceived at once , by the expression of the man who thus addressed him , that he had fallen into a trap , and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring .
It resulted , then , from this habit that on the said first Monday of April , 1625 , the citizens , on hearing the clamor , and seeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de Richelieu , rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller .
The duchess is at Tours , and the duke at Boulogne .
Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak , so I took advantage of his silence to walk off. ” “ Have you seen D ’ Artagnan ? ” “ We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him again. ” “ Oh ! ” said Athos , satirically , “ I saw him .

Then he advanced ; but before they could meet , the vessel again changed her course .
Monsieur de Beaufort or another .
Immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the _Pharaon_ , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old Phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city .
All was over ; carriages , horses , guards , and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds , when all at once a voice well known to Raoul was heard , and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air ; at the same time the crowd opened , upset , trodden down , and an officer of the musketeers , striking and cutting right and left , rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall .
Beauchamp , ” announced the servant .
The sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and I am to speak. ” “ Go , then , and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence , ” replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling .
“ Look , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ day is declining .
“ I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom , ” murmured Athos ; and the travelers continued their route .
The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years ; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time .

Chapter XLII .
“ I am all attention , ” said the abbé .
Grimaud and I got behind a tree , and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself , threw himself on his face in the road .
Where is he ? ” “ In my wife ’ s chamber , on the first flight , where they are dressing his wounds. ” “ His things and his bag are with him ?
This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 .
D ’ Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady .
A sublime action , at all events , for Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead .
“ Oh , don ’ t let that disturb you , ” cried Mme .
As Luigi spoke thus , he left her .
50183m “ Are you looking for anything , Mr. Procureur ? ” asked Benedetto , with his most ingratiating smile .
“ If Mousqueton were with us , ” observed Athos , on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers , “ how he would tremble at passing this !
The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously .
Some unknown enemy—an invisible foe—has done this. ” “ The more must you fortify yourself , Albert .
M. Danglars was out , but the count was asked to go and see the baroness , and he accepted the invitation .
He considered himself an outraged , betrayed , and ridiculed lover .
“ If I could die , ” he said , “ I should go where he goes , and should assuredly find him again .
“ My faith , ” said Aramis , “ we are all alike .
“ But , ” said Danglars thoughtfully , “ how is it that your patron , M. de Monte Cristo , did not make his proposal for you ? ” Andrea blushed imperceptibly .
“ Here ! ” cried the steward , “ here ! ” whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building .
“ Simply this , ” said the coadjutor .
Others proposed the _anguille_ , another kind of recreation , in which a handkerchief is filled with sand , pebbles , and two-sous pieces , when they have them , which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer .
If she flies , kill her ; but don ’ t exceed your orders. ” An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady ; but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning .
Then , turning to his desk , he said , striking the letter with the back of his right hand : “ Come , I had a forgery , three robberies , and two cases of arson , I only wanted a murder , and here it is .
One was perfectly charming , delicate , pensive , shaded by beautiful dark hair , and eyes soft as velvet , like those lovely flowers , the heartsease , in which shine out the golden petals .
“ Deserted ? ” she repeated ; “ ah , yes , I am , indeed , deserted !
I have been the cause of all your misfortunes ; but why do you pity , instead of blaming me ?
“ I said , my good fellow , that I would do more single-handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos , pistols , carbines , and blunderbusses included .
The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him .
Dantès approached the upper rock , which now , without any support , leaned towards the sea .
Debray ? ” inquired Danglars , with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile , acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker ’ s domestic life .
The crisis seemed past , a low moaning was heard , and he raised himself on one knee .
I have lost even the knife that saved me .
down with him ! ” was the cry .
“ Yes , I will reduce this rebellious city to ashes .

Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast ; but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended .
He insisted on being introduced , saying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti , or Monsieur de Beaufort , or Monsieur de Bouillon , or Monsieur d ’ Elbeuf , or the coadjutor , or Madame de Longueville , or Broussel , or the Parliament , and although he had come on his own private account , he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance .
“ Yes , ” replied the young woman ; “ and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one. ” “ I will undertake to divert him , ” replied the count .
The company of M. le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted D ’ Artagnan .
“ And is not this daughter dead ? ” demanded Monte Cristo ; “ I fancy I have heard so. ” “ Yes , monsieur , one-and-twenty years ago ; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times. ” “ Thanks , thanks , ” said Monte Cristo , judging from the steward ’ s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it .
I then resolved to go up to him at all risks .
She is all-powerful yonder ; she will help me .
‘ Come , ’ said the captain , ‘ we have done all in our power , and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with , we have tried to save the ship , let us now save ourselves .

Athos made him a sign to come with them .
“ When I awoke , a fresh meal was served .
They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret , left Bazin with him , who , besides , in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful , and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens .

Cries were heard from the interior , of which they could not comprehend the sense .
He was young , he had an old father whom he loved , a betrothed bride whom he adored .
If we ever escape together , half this treasure is yours ; if I die here , and you escape alone , the whole belongs to you. ” “ But , ” inquired Dantès hesitating , “ has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves ? ” “ No , no , be easy on that score ; the family is extinct .

Expenses on the road , about fifty francs ........ ....... 50 .
“ See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair , who was with me just now , is still in the palace. ” Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges , who was on guard .
“ Do you intend opening the door ? ” said the baroness .
He now wished to be amongst them , in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer ; he sighed for the galleys , with the infamous costume , the chain , and the brand on the shoulder .
And if you were mistaken , doctor—if it were not my daughter—if I should come one day , pale as a spectre , and say to you , ‘ Assassin , you have killed my child ! ’ —hold—if that should happen , although I am a Christian , M. d ’ Avrigny , I should kill myself. ” “ Well , ” said the doctor , after a moment ’ s silence , “ I will wait. ” Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words .
We traversed Greece , and arrived half dead at the imperial gates .
We must have felt what it is to die , Morrel , that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living .
have you your sword , Athos ? ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville , who was standing in the waiting-room , and who was introduced into Danglars ’ room as soon as the count had left .
The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved .
He said he was going to the Catalans , and he is going to the city .
If you go accompanied by any other person , or should anyone else go in your place , the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it. ” This postscript decreased greatly the young girl ’ s happiness .

No , no , doubtless he was deceived , and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death !
I only , as you see , have remained poor , wretched , and forgotten. ” “ You are mistaken , my friend , ” replied the abbé ; “ God may seem sometimes to forget for a time , while his justice reposes , but there always comes a moment when he remembers—and behold—a proof ! ” As he spoke , the abbé took the diamond from his pocket , and giving it to Caderousse , said , “ Here , my friend , take this diamond , it is yours. ” “ What , for me only ? ” cried Caderousse , “ ah , sir , do not jest with me ! ” “ This diamond was to have been shared among his friends .
The air was soft and clear , as it generally is at that early hour of the morning .
I had quarelled with him some time previously , and had even challenged him to fight me ; but he refused. ” “ Now we are getting on .
One thing above all the rest heightened the respect , nay almost the veneration , of Danglars for Cavalcanti .

“ Apropos , ” she said , as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself , “ how is poor Voiture , do you know , Scarron ? ” “ What , is Monsieur Voiture ill ? ” inquired a gentleman who had spoken to Athos in the Rue Saint Honore ; “ what is the matter with him ? ” “ He was acting , but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance , ” said the coadjutor , “ so he took cold and is about to die. ” “ Is he then so ill , dear Voiture ? ” asked Aramis , half hidden by the window curtain .
Ah !
how pale you are !
“ And why not ? ” demanded D ’ Artagnan .
Bonacieux .
“ Still it belongs to government , and I ought not to waste it ; but , having received the signal that I might rest for an hour ” ( here he glanced at the sun-dial , for there was everything in the enclosure of Montlhéry , even a sun-dial ) , “ and having ten minutes before me , and my strawberries being ripe , when a day longer—by-the-by , sir , do you think dormice eat them ? ” “ Indeed , I should think not , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved , as the Romans did. ” “ What ?

I suppose that is not all. ” “ To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up Mazarin a little. ” “ A bad plan ; you ’ ll be shut up again in the Bastile. ” “ Oh , as to that , I shall take care , I assure you .
50189m “ Oh ! ” he exclaimed , as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart .
“ One has never the last word with such a man .
After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl—a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst .

“ I am from Gascony , it is true ; and since you know it , there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons are not very patient , so that when they have begged to be excused once , were it even for a folly , they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done. ” “ Monsieur , what I say to you about the matter , ” said Aramis , “ is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel .
“ We fear so , and our only regret is to die so far from both of you. ” “ What will you do in a foreign land , an enemy ’ s country ? ” “ I traveled in England when I was young , I speak English like an Englishman , and Aramis , too , knows something of the language .

“ Do not call anyone—do not be alarmed , ” said the count ; “ do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast ; the man standing before you , Valentine ( for this time it is no ghost ) , is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of. ” Valentine could not reply ; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room , alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable ; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire , “ If your intentions are pure , why are you here ? ” The count ’ s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl ’ s mind .

This noble entrance , however , in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases , as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom , had fallen into utter disuse .
Felton , then , had spoken in her favor , since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to him .

“ Athos ! ” exclaimed D ’ Artagnan .
But how to die ?
That little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers. ” “ Very well , monsieur ; I will obey you at all points. ” Athos made two visits in Paris ; at seven o ’ clock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles ; it was stopped by porters , horses and footmen .
“ I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch .

“ That ’ s all that is necessary , ” said Athos ; “ now for my idea. ” “ I should like , however , to comprehend , ” said Porthos .
“ I offer my best respects and services to you , my lord. ” D ’ Artagnan then , returning to the officer , said : “ Sir , have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to say ’ tis by his eminence ’ s order , and that I shall await him at the stables. ” The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter .

The servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard ; some , belonging to the kitchens , gliding down the stairs , restored but the previous day , as if they had always inhabited the house ; others filling the coach-houses , where the equipages , encased and numbered , appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years ; and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms , who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters .
Sometimes he weeps bitterly , sometimes laughs boisterously , at other time he passes hours on the seashore , flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘ duck-and-drake ’ five or six times , he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz .
“ The deuce ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
The cannonade of the Isle of Ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cévennes ; the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes .

We can wait the more contentedly , that it is not absolutely bad here , but for one thing , at least. ” “ What is that ? ” “ Did you observe , D ’ Artagnan , that three days running they have brought us braised mutton ? ” “ No ; but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it , so never mind. ” “ And then I feel the loss of my house , ’ tis a long time since I visited my castles. ” “ Forget them for a time ; we shall return to them , unless Mazarin razes them to the ground. ” “ Do you think that likely ? ” “ No , the other cardinal would have done so , but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it. ” “ You reconcile me , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ Well , then , assume a cheerful manner , as I do ; we must joke with the guards , we must gain the good-will of the soldiers , since we can ’ t corrupt them .
Be assured , then , of seeing me soon return. ” “ Capital ! ” cried Athos ; “ you are the king of poets , my dear Aramis .
Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground ; but the horse and its rider , of whom he did not lose sight , were evidently sinking .
Hallo , Dantès !
She has a carriage , then , this niece of the doctor ? ” interrupted Porthos , one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue .
Once more , let me thank you , my good friends , both in my own name and the queen ’ s. ” The three gentlemen then shook hands , Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore , and Athos and Aramis remaining together .

“ In that case , ” said he , “ I should lose her , and by my own fault. ” He dwelt on this idea for a moment , then it appeared reality .
Athos and his friends , again mingling with the throng , were taking a last look at the martyr king .
“ Because he left no Commentaries , ” replied La Ramee , with his coarse laugh .

Answer , for I have many things to tell you , too ; indeed , the last three days some odd adventures have happened—but what is the matter ?
“ I understand , ” answered Porthos , “ I understand you perfectly , on my honor ; two hundred louis , each of us , would be making a pretty thing of it ; but what will people say ? ” “ Let them say what they will ; besides , how will they know that we are doing it ? ” “ But who will distribute these things ? ” asked Porthos .

Fortunately Lord de Winter is rich. ” “ Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment ; Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources. ” “ Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful. ” “ Now it is that I regret D ’ Artagnan. ” “ Let us entice them away. ” “ This secret , Aramis , does not belong to us ; take my advice , then , and let no one into our confidence .

Wait here for me. ” And looking attentively around him , to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets , Mazarin went out .
“ You are a great almsgiver , ” said the visitor , “ and although you are said to be rich , I will venture to offer you something for your poor people ; will you accept my offering ? ” “ I thank you , sir ; I am only jealous in one thing , and that is that the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources. ” “ However—— ” “ My resolution , sir , is unchangeable , but you have only to search for yourself and you will find , alas , but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence. ” The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door , the stranger bowed and took his leave , and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M. de Villefort .

Raoul sprang from his horse , to which he left the charge of its own preservation , and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman ’ s side ; he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water ; the animal began to breathe again and , as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid , redoubled his efforts .

Then , once free , from the day and hour and moment when he was so , he could have but one only thought , which was , to gain Monte Cristo by some means , and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions ; and once there , to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns , and search in the appointed spot , —the appointed spot , be it remembered , being the farthest angle in the second opening .

Let them take my fortune , I am already too rich ; and , perhaps , when they have taken it , they will leave me in peace and quietness .
“ There is the wounded man , ” said De Guiche , passing close to the Augustine brother .
Your hand , madame , your hand , and I depart ! ” Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand , closing her eyes , and leaning with the other upon Estafania , for she felt that her strength was about to fail her .
“ Ah , ” replied he , guessing Franz ’ s thought , “ I know this is a serious matter. ” “ What should you do in my place ? ” “ I , who have nothing to lose , —I should go. ” 20075m “ You would accept ? ” “ Yes , were it only out of curiosity. ” “ There is something very peculiar about this chief , then ? ” “ Listen , ” said Gaetano , lowering his voice , “ I do not know if what they say is true ” —he stopped to see if anyone was near .
I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort , her devotion to the elder Dantès .
“ Grief has consumed her , ” said Villefort— “ yes , grief , doctor !
Fighting here , are you ?
Besides , Athos was very easy , and a noble to his fingers ’ ends .
“ But is this all that is known ? ” “ They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him. ” “ On his track ? ” said Villefort .
His calm , noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head .
“ Oho ! ” said he , “ is the hotel on fire ? ” On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found , however , that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected .
‘ Take courage , Vasiliki , ’ said he ; ‘ today arrives the firman of the master , and my fate will be decided .
All these rooms , which communicated with one another , did not inspire Porthos favorably .
The first risk that Dantès ran was , that the jailer , when he brought him his supper at seven o ’ clock , might perceive the change that had been made ; fortunately , twenty times at least , from misanthropy or fatigue , Dantès had received his jailer in bed , and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table , and went away without saying a word .
The two lower rooms consisted of a dining-room , with a table , chairs , and side-board of walnut , and a wainscoted parlor , without ornaments , carpet , or timepiece .
Bazin ! ” cried the four young men , calling their lackeys , “ clean my boots , and fetch the horses from the hôtel. ” Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel , as at a barrack , his own horse and that of his lackey .
“ Yes , sire , ” interrupted Aramis , raising his voice , “ Bishop Juxon , the faithful knight of Christ , obedient to your majesty ’ s wishes. ” Charles clasped his hands , amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners , without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them , thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king .
Go ; go directly ! ” D ’ Artagnan rose , took his hat , as if it had been his intention to obey , then , opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase , he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of Milady .
“ Horses , nowadays , are not what they were formerly , ” observed Porthos ; “ everything degenerates. ” “ I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin , ” said Aramis .
For instance , having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier , I resolved to try one last means , and for three months I have been giving him brucine ; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains .
“ Bravo , bravo , ” said Franz ; “ things go wonderfully .
I congratulate you !
“ Don ’ t laugh , my friend ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ for heaven ’ s sake , don ’ t laugh , for upon my soul , it ’ s no laughing matter ! ” And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror , that Athos eagerly seized his hand , crying , “ Are you wounded , my friend ?
“ Do you know the house of Thomson & French ? ” “ Yes , I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000 francs ; but since then I have not heard it mentioned. ” “ It is one of the best houses in Europe , ” said Danglars , carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk .
The Waking When Franz returned to himself , he seemed still to be in a dream .
Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle , owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king .
“ But , ” said Grimaud , in the same silent dialect , “ we shall leave our skins there. ” Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven .
“ What ? ” asked his Lordship .
“ Ah , La Ramee !
“ Well , grandpapa , ” said Valentine , kneeling before him , and pointing to Maximilian , “ I love him , and will be only his ; were I compelled to marry another , I would destroy myself. ” The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts .
Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold .
“ Be assured you will not find her Majesty ungrateful. ” “ Oh , I am already grandly recompensed ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
Can not Monsieur Cromwell wait a little ? ” “ Yes , but I ? ” said Mordaunt .
The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert , who made the lofty building re-echo with the sound of his friend ’ s name .
Groslow , whom D ’ Artagnan ’ s praises had greatly pleased , welcomed him with a gracious smile .
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques .
my son !
“ What is the matter ? ” said the count .
At the moment he opened the door , the three Musketeers and D ’ Artagnan , conducted by La Chesnaye , appeared at the top of the staircase .
The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace .
“ What an injustice , my dear invalid !
There is an abundance of Italian masks at the Palais Royal , from harlequin even to pantaloon. ” “ Chevalier !
What do you want of me ? ” she asked , in great distress .
“ Oh , ” cried she , without losing any of her cheerfulness , “ this is singular !
Has he not already forgotten she ever existed ?
You suit me very well. ” Baptistin bowed low .
Full of hope , Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water , and , thanks to the vigor of his constitution , found himself well-nigh recovered .
And now , gentlemen , I repeat , excuse me , but on that account only , and—on guard ! ” At these words , with the most gallant air possible , D ’ Artagnan drew his sword .
He knows my tastes , my caprices , my wants .
He did not even see the ocean , that terrible barrier against freedom , which the prisoners look upon with utter despair .
This time I have merely come from Cadiz. ” “ You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit .
Where was I then ?
Do you not see how she suffers ? ” Haydée answered with a heartrending expression , “ Why should he understand this , my sister ?
Bazin remained at the window .
Five minutes after , M. de Tréville was asking D ’ Artagnan what he could do to serve him , and what caused his visit at so late an hour .
The general ’ s carriage was ready , but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it , since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went .
I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self-examination ; let us drop the subject , and adopt the middle course of delay , which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement .
Debray , perhaps , as it was once proposed .
He hastened to the rendezvous , found the lackeys at their posts , placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel , and came to find Athos , who had just received this information when his friends returned .
Then in the long days on board ship , when the vessel , gliding on with security over the azure sea , required no care but the hand of the helmsman , thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails , Edmond , with a chart in his hand , became the instructor of Jacopo , as the poor Abbé Faria had been his tutor .
What comments must be made ; and if the Fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared , how the Fronde must triumph ! ” “ It is frightful , ” murmured Mazarin .
“ But what must I do ? ” asked Milady .
“ Gentlemen , you see , ” said the duke to those present , who dared not even smile , “ that it is the ‘ Illustrious Coxcomb ’ who is the greatest thief in the world ; at least , according to Pistache. ” “ Let us go on to another of his exercises. ” “ Gentlemen ! ” —there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them— “ do you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons , whom he styled ‘ the fairest of the fair ? ’ Pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs .
“ I have my plan .
“ My fair friend , ” said Athos , “ allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war .
He then turned to the left , down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends , but as he opened the door he paused , as if in thought .
“ We are invited , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ to pass the night with M. Groslow .
“ You know it is not my fault , ” said Morrel .
Grimaud nodded assent .
His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence ; his lips were straight , and so thin that , as they closed , they were drawn in over the teeth ; his cheek-bones were broad and projecting , a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness ; while the flatness of his forehead , and the enlargement of the back of his skull , which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears , combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing , save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable , more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt , and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole .
One evening , after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans , she returned to her home more depressed than ever .
You have been to London !
“ And then , ” said Aramis , pinching his ear to make it red , as he rubbed his hands to make them white , “ and then I made a certain _rondeau_ upon it last year , which I showed to Monsieur Voiture , and that great man paid me a thousand compliments. ” “ A _rondeau ! _ ” said the Jesuit , disdainfully .
“ Farewell , my son , ” said the curate , “ till tomorrow. ” “ Till tomorrow , rash youth , ” said the Jesuit .
40124m “ Listen , ” cried he ; “ pity me—help me !
I will give them to you on condition that you let me go. ” “ Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000 ?
“ Ha !
The poor mercer remained standing at the door , while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him , and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past .
“ Weak or strong , ” repeated Milady , “ that man has , then , a spark of pity in his soul ; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him .
Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast , had got some water from a spring , spread out the fruit and bread , and cooked the kid .
sir , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side ? ” “ No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers. ” “ Well , that is scarcely the question .
Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen .
why have we not a Grimaud near every prince ? ” “ Patience ! ” replied Mazarin , with his Italian smile ; “ that may happen one day ; but in the meantime—— ” “ Well , in the meantime ? ” “ I shall still take precautions. ” And he wrote to D ’ Artagnan to hasten his return .
“ But on our return , ” he said aloud , “ may we , that is , my friend and I , depend on having , he his barony , and I my promotion ? ” “ On the honor of Mazarin. ” “ I should like another sort of oath better , ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself ; then aloud , “ May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen ? ” “ Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly , ” replied Mazarin ; “ go , pray , sir—— ” “ One word more , my lord ; if there ’ s any fighting where I ’ m going , must I fight ? ” “ You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed the inclosed letter. ” “ ’ Tis well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , holding out his hand to receive the money .
The fit lasted two hours ; then , more helpless than an infant , and colder and paler than marble , more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot , he fell back , doubled up in one last convulsion , and became as rigid as a corpse .
Ah , my friend ! ” said the abbé , turning towards Dantès , and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet , “ you are young , you will see all this come to pass. ” “ Probably , if ever I get out of prison ! ” “ True , ” replied Faria , “ we are prisoners ; but I forget this sometimes , and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls , and I fancy myself at liberty. ” “ But wherefore are you here ? ” “ Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in 1811 ; because , like Machiavelli , I desired to alter the political face of Italy , and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities , each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler , I sought to form one large , compact , and powerful empire ; and , lastly , because I fancied I had found my Cæsar Borgia in a crowned simpleton , who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me .
Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along ; his leg was inert , and he could no longer make use of one arm .
“ I will stop at the first posting-house , ” said Danglars to himself .
“ We might start at five o ’ clock and be in time , but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night , and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels .
_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew , very obedient to their captain , who lost as little time as possible .
“ May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M. de Morcerf so early ? ” “ Had you not a meeting with my son this morning ? ” asked the general .
Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes .
“ Because , ” answered the Gascon , “ we were sent , Porthos and I , by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell ; instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I.—not the same thing by any means .
“ Himself , my lord. ” “ But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist. ” “ Phew ! ” whistled Planchet .
Have you neglected to obtain information on that point ?
the son of Marie Michon !
“ And you , too , my poor Monsieur Mouston , are out of place in this poor hotel , are you not ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan , in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery .
As he passed the Hôtel des Gardes , he took a glance into the stables .
What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go ? ” “ Why , I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily. ” “ Bravo , Porthos !
He hit him but once , but as he had foretold , that hit was a mortal one ; the sword pierced his heart .
and how proceed ? ” “ It is now eleven , ” answered Grimaud .
But no , I found nothing , though I had made a hole twice as large as the first .
Thus , for instance , don ’ t you in the first place want a horse ? ” “ Yes , a horse. ” “ Well , then !
He turned towards the fortress , and looked at both sea and land .
We will see , my dear monsieur , if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box. ” “ You see plainly that I have no sword , ” said the Englishman .
He stopped , however , at the door for an instant .
And I , doctor—you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupy—one has not been king ’ s attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies ; mine are numerous .
This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter , if Lord de Winter did not marry .
But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile , that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes .
She must have a long arm. ” “ Hush ! ” said Porthos , placing a finger on his lips .
This idea , while darkening his brow , drew several sighs from him , and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance .
3 , which he had occupied on his last stay at Compiègne .
’ tis a bad example .
“ In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls. ” “ You are very happy , ” exclaimed Athos , laughing , in spite of himself , at the sally of the irresistible Gascon ; “ for you see the bright side of everything. ” “ What would you have ? ” said D ’ Artagnan .
As to the other , he knows me , he fears me , and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his hands .
It is true they might have taken others , but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet , as we have seen , had no liking for forests after dark .
Someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged .
Fortunately , Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely ; and , as they reached him , he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July came .
But consider , D ’ Artagnan , ” added he , in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder , “ consider that Béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who , wherever she goes , brings misery with her .
Barrois touched a spring , the false bottom came out , and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string .
Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Cromwell. ” “ But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt , whom I bade you distrust ? ” asked Athos .
As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped , as if guessing that he was the man they wanted .
FATALITY Meantime Milady , drunk with passion , roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked , had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast , for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by D ’ Artagnan , threatened by Athos , and that she had quit France without being revenged on them .
“ Enter , gentlemen , ” said Laporte , “ since the queen desires you so to do. ” Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe .
“ This is fine ! ” said Porthos to himself ; “ I am prettily caught ! ” He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves , and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of Mme .
Now , I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you , from the bottom of my heart. ” The count bowed again , but lower than before ; he was even paler than Mercédès .
“ We must inform the queen. ” “ Ah , my faith , yes ! ” said Porthos and D ’ Artagnan , at the same time ; “ we are coming nearer to it now. ” “ Inform the queen ! ” said Athos ; “ and how ?
“ Oh , yes , ” she exclaimed , “ I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much , and seemed to ease my aching brain .
Then , extending his hand , the old man said ; ‘ I thank you , my son ; and now leave me alone. ’ “ ‘ Yet—— ’ replied Carlini .
Raoul trembled , lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse , for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy , but either instinctively , or from affection for the duchess , he said everything in her favor .
“ Oho ! ” said he , “ what is this ?
At the same time Mercédès reappeared , paler than before , but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore .
Bertuccio appeared .
She _must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers. ” And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage .
She then made an extraordinary effort to receive him , but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile .
At the centre window , the one hung with white damask with a red cross , was a blue domino , beneath which Franz ’ s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the Argentina .
“ Arrested ! ” he exclaimed ; “ he was taken at Compiègne , and all is over. ” Madame Danglars rose from her seat , pale and cold .
Besides , the physician might declare the ailment feigned ; and Milady , after having lost the first trick , was not willing to lose the second .
You spent it as you pleased ; that was your business .
Why do we hate ?
But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend , the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars , “ I must speak to you. ” “ When ? ” “ Tomorrow. ” “ Where ? ” “ In my office , or in the court , if you like , —that is the surest place. ” “ I will be there. ” At this moment Madame de Villefort approached .
I can ’ t leave you alone in this abominable country. ” “ Thanks , my worthy friend .
Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand , which she as usual raised to her lips .
“ In that case , in the name of heaven , ” continued he , throwing him a pistole , “ tell me what you have seen , and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart. ” The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen , and repeated in a low voice : “ It was scarcely nine o ’ clock when I heard a noise in the street , and was wondering what it could be , when on coming to my door , I found that somebody was endeavoring to open it .
The queen is too virtuous ; and besides , loves your Majesty too well. ” “ Woman is weak , Monsieur Cardinal , ” said the king ; “ and as to loving me much , I have my own opinion as to that love. ” “ I not the less maintain , ” said the cardinal , “ that the Duke of Buckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political. ” “ And I am sure that he came for quite another purpose , Monsieur Cardinal ; but if the queen be guilty , let her tremble ! ” “ Indeed , ” said the cardinal , “ whatever repugnance I may have to directing my mind to such a treason , your Majesty compels me to think of it .
The lieutenant ’ s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing-room ; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention , but began to arrange , with so much cleverness , nicety and gayety , his straw bed , that the mouths of all these poor creatures , who could not go to sleep , began to water .
It was also considered a luxury to have them alive , it being an amusing sight to see them die , for , when dying , they change color three or four times , and like the rainbow when it disappears , pass through all the prismatic shades , after which they were sent to the kitchen .
Lead two sheep to the butcher ’ s , two oxen to the slaughterhouse , and make one of them understand that his companion will not die ; the sheep will bleat for pleasure , the ox will bellow with joy .
For women have infallible instincts ; they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented ; but I , who only understand my own figures , know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me .
Heavens !
THE PAVILION At nine o ’ clock D ’ Artagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes ; he found Planchet all ready .
“ Gentlemen , ” said he , “ leave me alone with Patrick and Laporte—ah , is that you , De Winter ?
Yes , it is one of Milady ’ s bastards ! ” “ You laugh Aramis. ” “ From habit , that is all .
“ Possibly , ” continued Aramis , “ came toward me , accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him ; and in the politest tone , ‘ Monsieur Duke , ’ said he to me , ‘ and you madame , ’ continued he , addressing the lady on my arm— ” “ The doctor ’ s niece ? ” “ Hold your tongue , Porthos , ” said Athos ; “ you are insupportable. ” “ ‘ —will you enter this carriage , and that without offering the least resistance , without making the least noise ? ’ ” “ He took you for Buckingham ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
The cardinal put it on in military style .
He had my love !
The guests were still at table , and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South , where unhappily , for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling .
At length the reading of the indictment was ended .
Oh , I can not tell what she says to me !
The Examination Chapter 8 .
I did not even touch your hand , and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant. ” “ Yes , but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no part , as you well know , my Lord .
I have even informed him of a circumstance I consider very serious ; the young man was either charmed by his nurse , stolen by gypsies , or lost by his tutor , I scarcely know which .
A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation , while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity .
The young count ’ s conversation was most interesting to Raoul , therefore he listened much , whilst the count talked well and long .
By no means ! ” said D ’ Artagnan .
THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TRÉVILLE M. de Troisville , as his family was still called in Gascony , or M. de Tréville , as he has ended by styling himself in Paris , had really commenced life as D ’ Artagnan now did ; that is to say , without a sou in his pocket , but with a fund of audacity , shrewdness , and intelligence which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his .
“ Here it is , ” said Aramis , with a little look of diffidence , which , however , was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy : “ Vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes , Et qui trainez des jours infortunés , Tous vos malheurs se verront terminés , Quand à Dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes , Vous qui pleurez ! ” “ You who weep for pleasures fled , While dragging on a life of care , All your woes will melt in air , If to God your tears are shed , You who weep ! ” D ’ Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased .
At the same time Monte Cristo ’ s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before , “ Whatever you want , Morrel , come to me ; I have great power. ” More rapidly than thought , he darted down the Rue Matignon , and thence to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées .
The cardinal , however , did not unseal the letter at once , but continued to turn it again and again in his hand ; then , in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them , fixing his eyes upon them at the same time , he thus addressed the messenger : “ You are very young , Monsieur Mordaunt , for this difficult task of ambassador , in which the oldest diplomatists often fail. ” “ My lord , I am twenty-three years of age ; but your eminence is mistaken in saying that I am young .
Teresa had yielded in spite of herself , but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man , she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him .
Lastly , her hair , which , from being light in her youth , had become chestnut , and which she wore curled very plainly , and with much powder , admirably set off her face , in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge , and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose .
Planchet grasped him by the throat , and pressed as hard as he could .
He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty , who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace .
Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier , and D ’ Artagnan toward the Rue Férou .
The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely .
But let us return to yourself .
His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses , worth 32,000 francs , to Madame Danglars ; his second , the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villefort ’ s life ; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club .
“ It is very simple , ” Mousqueton had said ; “ he is thinking of Groslow. ” It was Captain Groslow , the reader will remember , who had broken Parry ’ s head .
But they are calling me .
Two of her companions were dressed , the one as a woman of Nettuno , and the other as a woman of La Riccia .
Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen ; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody , out of respect , withdrew several steps , so that nobody had heard anything .
Where are your Musketeers ?
However , you may look and see , ” added the lackey , raising the curtained entrance of the tent .
And as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms .
Nothing was heard but cries of “ Live the Musketeers !
All minds were uneasy , most were foreboding , many of the people used threatening language .
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of D ’ Artagnan .
On my soul , handsome stirrups !
“ Halloo , gentlemen ! ” he called out in his Gascon accent , “ what do you want ?
“ No , sir , and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious. ” “ In fact , ” said Aramis , “ there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly .
Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place , and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides , who , holding torches in their hands , had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum , and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins , resembling , as they glided along , some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many _ignes fatui_ .

“ There is , then , the second point cleared up , or nearly so , ” said Eugénie , without the least confusion , and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language ; “ and you appear satisfied with the explanation .
But he had gone farther than Athos—for at the village of Festubert , while drinking at an inn , he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before , at half-past eight , a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged to stop , unable to go further .
At the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire , and he was obliged to obey .
D ’ Artagnan turned toward her , saying , “ Then send him away , madame. ” “ Pooh ! ” said the Swiss , who had needed a little time to take in D ’ Artagnan ’ s proposal , “ pooh !
In the meantime , I remain here .
Indeed , every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place ; and every day the cardinal , under some pretext , deferred fixing it .
I understand my game , Kitty ; I have this one safe. ” “ What will you do with him , madame ? ” “ What will I do with him ?
Wrapped in this sweet idea , D ’ Artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience , his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings , attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment .
I am not unhappy while I possess my son ! ” “ Ah , just so , ” said Albert ; “ here begins the trial .
“ What you ask is impossible ; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about , and some day you will meet the governor , and if he chooses to reply , that is his affair. ” “ But , ” asked Dantès , “ how long shall I have to wait ? ” “ Ah , a month—six months—a year. ” “ It is too long a time .
“ Lord de Winter ! ” exclaimed the count .
“ Why , it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course. ” “ Is that possible ? ” “ True as day .
Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me ? ” “ Thanks , count , no , ” replied De Winter .
“ It is , in truth , monsieur le coadjuteur ’ s carriage , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us. ” He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman ’ s little finger .
“ I like , ” said he , “ to feel a hand like this , when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause. ” “ It seems to me , ” said Emmanuel , “ that I see two young men down there , who are evidently , waiting. ” Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law .
The pilot again changed the course of the boat , which rapidly approached the island , and was soon within fifty paces of it .
War between England and France was talked of as near and certain , and the jolly sailors were having a carousal .
The distance was short , and at the end of ten minutes his carriage , or rather the count ’ s , stopped before the Hôtel de Londres .
The duchess remained a moment stupefied ; then , suddenly bursting into laughter : “ Ah !

I try to be beloved , not feared. ” “ Well , there is on the wall of my cell , scratched with a nail , a proverb , which says , ‘ Like master , like servant. ’ ” “ Pray , what does that mean ? ” “ It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants , dozens and dozens of them. ” “ He !
I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune ; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity .
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself .
“ You are right , ” said she , “ I have often thought of it. ” Then she added in a low voice , “ And I will think of it again. ” Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones ; probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion .
This was neither long nor difficult .
“ Ah , ha , ” whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment , “ he is only a thief. ” But the man in the dark could not find the right key .

This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which I inspire you , in the name of the service you have rendered me and which I never shall forget while I have life .
“ It concerns the best interests of your father , ” said the messenger .
What the count said was true—the most curious spectacle in life is that of death .
The next morning D ’ Artagnan summoned the host , one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer .
Well , over that coach-house are the servants ’ rooms , with bells corresponding with the different apartments. ” “ Ah , _diable ! _ bells did you say ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Oh , nothing !
At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and , bending his bare head , tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant .
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event—that is to say , till two o ’ clock in the afternoon—two vessels had already left the port , the one bearing , as we know , Milady , who , already anticipating the event , was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral ’ s ship .
Well , he is a man of bad taste , and is still more enchanted with another .
The president rang the bell .
This will be , ” added Noirtier , with a smile , “ one means by which you may a second time save me , if the political balance should some day take another turn , and cast you aloft while hurling me down .
It bears his signature , as you see , which is all-sufficient. ” “ Bring me a million such as that , ” said Danglars , “ I shall be well pleased , ” putting the draft in his pocket .

40130m “ No , he wished to speak to your excellency ; I told him you were gone out , and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter , which he had brought with him already sealed. ” “ Give it me , ” said Andrea , and he read by the light of his carriage-lamp : “ ‘ You know where I live ; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o ’ clock. ’ ” Andrea examined it carefully , to ascertain if the letter had been opened , or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents ; but it was so carefully folded , that no one could have read it , and the seal was perfect .
And as the man approached , D ’ Artagnan , in order to have more freedom for his actions , leaned half out of the door ; his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant , which were lighted up by a lantern .
Ten other carriages followed , containing the ladies of honor , the officers of the royal household , and the court .
The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message .
“ A moment , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half-drawn swords .
The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings ; silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons , whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen .
“ You are here ! ” said she .
Athos stretched out his hand toward her .
I beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish , too Italian , or too Arabian .
“ You will excuse my leaving you , ” said the count , turning in the direction of his box .
Now , whither do you conduct me ? ” “ Into my room first , ” replied Comminges ; “ the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile. ” Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word .
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness , only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes , like the effects of a fever ; his brow was more pale than it generally was ; his teeth were clenched , and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him .
However , his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile , so much was every mind engaged , and so solemn was the situation .
Bonacieux made no reply ; but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes .
Alas , what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good ? ” 50271m Then he said aloud : “ Listen , Morrel , I see your grief is great , but still you do not like to risk your soul. ” Morrel smiled sadly .
“ I have , ” replied Morrel .
My lackey and I will have three shots at you , and you will get as many from the cellar .
Come along , Danglars , and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses. ” Danglars took advantage of Caderousse ’ s temper at the moment , to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor , staggering as he went .
Which is my best cavalry horse ? ” “ Vulcan. ” “ And the best hack ? ” “ Bayard. ” “ What horse dost thou choose for thyself ? ” “ I like Rustaud , my lord ; a good animal , whose paces suit me. ” “ Strong , thinkest thou ? ” “ Half Norman , half Mecklenburger ; will go night and day. ” “ That will do for us .
The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue .
We are all invited , my father , Madame de Villefort , and I—at least , I understood it so. ” “ When will it be our turn to think of these things ?
In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait .
A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface .
without caring about them myself , I live among those who are much occupied in them .
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT Meanwhile the king , who , with more reason than the cardinal , showed his hatred for Buckingham , although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the English from the Isle of Ré , and afterward to press the siege of La Rochelle ; but notwithstanding his earnest wish , he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between MM .
It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting .
She saw vaguely the future ; but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas , as yet confused , a distinct form and a regular plan .

“ He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die , ” said the Gascon to himself .
Upon my word , you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him. ” “ Oh , as for parricides , and such dreadful people as that , ” interposed Renée , “ it matters very little what is done to them ; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues—— ” “ Why , that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit ; for , don ’ t you see , Renée , the king is the father of his people , and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls , is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale ? ” “ I don ’ t know anything about that , ” replied Renée ; “ but , M. de Villefort , you have promised me—have you not ? —always to show mercy to those I plead for. ” “ Make yourself quite easy on that point , ” answered Villefort , with one of his sweetest smiles ; “ you and I will always consult upon our verdicts. ” “ My love , ” said the marquise , “ attend to your doves , your lap-dogs , and embroidery , but do not meddle with what you do not understand .
If you are not located in the United States , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook .
“ Good-evening , Maximilian ; I know I have kept you waiting , but you saw the cause of my delay. ” “ Yes , I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars .
Madame de Villefort merely cried , “ Be still , Edward ! ” She then added , “ This young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty .
From this view of things , then , comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action , seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous .
He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber , writing orders with his own hand .
He drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those generous Frenchmen ; he kissed it , and then , as he reflected , that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb , there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death .
Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger , which , no doubt , in acknowledgement of the compliment , lowered her own shallop into the sea , and the five boats worked so well that by two o ’ clock in the morning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune Amélie_ and on _terra firma_ .
As for me , I have almost forgotten the little Latin I have ever known .
“ I expected this , ” said Felton .
“ Precisely , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but I perceive I have not much to teach you .
With the deputy ’ s knowledge of crime and criminals , every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence .
Unluckily , as I was then in Bearn , on account of my father ’ s death , the letter followed me there .
The hostess threw herself at his feet , asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence .
“ As for that , M. Morrel , ” said he , again turning his quid , “ as for that—— ” “ As for what ? ” “ The money. ” “ Well—— ” “ Well , we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present , and that we will wait for the rest. ” “ Thanks , my friends , thanks ! ” cried Morrel gratefully ; “ take it—take it ; and if you can find another employer , enter his service ; you are free to do so. ” These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman .
“ Besides , ” continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking— “ besides , who says that it will begin again ? ” “ It has returned , count , ” exclaimed Morrel ; “ that is why I hastened to you. ” “ Well , what do you wish me to do ?
“ It is a color very well known in botany , but till the present time very rare among horses. ” “ There are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master , ” cried the young emulator of the furious Tréville .
“ No , ” said Morrel ; “ is someone dead in his house ? ” “ The general has just blown his brains out , ” replied Monte Cristo with great coolness .
A being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him. ” Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard , the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived .

The witnesses thought he was dead , but his adversary , who knew he had not struck him , offered him the assistance of his hand to rise .

“ Toward Paris. ” “ Who stopped him ? ” “ Two young gentlemen , who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mention—the Viscount de Bragelonne. ” “ And it was this young man who brought the monk to you ?
Dantès dived again , and remained a long time beneath the water .
Milady raised her head , saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos , and screamed .
“ At another time , ” added he , “ I should have said , Give them , besides , two hundred francs over as a present ; but times are changed , and the little money that remains to me is not my own , so do not think me mean on this account. ” Penelon turned to his companions , and exchanged a few words with them .
“ My good , my brave Guitant , whatsoever command I may give you in that language—in French—whatever I may order you to do , will you not perform it ? ” “ Certainly .
“ Yes , I have , ” replied Franz ; “ I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered. ” “ Cæsar ’ s _Commentaries_ , ” said the bandit , “ it is my favorite work. ” “ Well , are you coming ? ” asked Albert .
“ Come , Barrois , ” said the young girl , “ take some of this lemonade ; I see you are coveting a good draught of it. ” “ The fact is , mademoiselle , ” said Barrois , “ I am dying with thirst , and since you are so kind as to offer it me , I can not say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it. ” “ Take some , then , and come back immediately. ” Barrois took away the waiter , and hardly was he outside the door , which in his haste he forgot to shut , than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled .
I answered , ‘ In Greece. ’ — ‘ Then , ’ said he , ‘ write to Yanina. ’ ” “ And who thus advised you ? ” “ No other than your friend , Monte Cristo. ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina ? ” “ Yes ; and I wrote , and will show you my correspondence , if you like. ” Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other .
And yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels. ” “ Do you know this ring ? ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Ay ! ” said Porthos , “ the thing would not be impossible with a good plan. ” “ I have none , ” said Athos ; “ but D ’ Artagnan will discover one. ” D ’ Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded .
D ’ Artagnan had not been deceived ; these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him , hoping that the young man ’ s death would be placed to the account of the enemy .
“ Where are we going ? ” asked he , by a gesture .
They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night , and left him to himself during the day .
With much pleasure , your excellency , if it would amuse you ; and I will get you the torch you ask for .
Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work ! ” “ But , ” asked Danglars , in a timid tone , “ how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement ? ” “ The contract , ” answered Dantès , laughingly , “ it didn ’ t take long to fix that .
0177m “ What is he doing there ? ” said the inspector .
They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs .
“ Well , _pardieu ! _ there is yours , my dear friend , ” replied D ’ Artagnan .
If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart , it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival .
I make a match ?
They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract , which half Paris assembled was to sign .
“ What do you want me for , sir ? ” demanded he of the paralytic .
D ’ Artagnan , on his return , sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the Guards , with strict orders that great care should be taken of it ; and then , on the day appointed , as the dinner was fixed for midday D ’ Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment .
“ Me !
The latter retained the count ’ s hand between his .
He had not so noble an air as Athos , and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman , whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress .
Acknowledge , that if Albert is brave , he can not be a coward ; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning , and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise. ” “ Doubtless , doubtless , ” said Morrel ; “ but I shall say , like the Spaniard , ‘ He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday. ’ ” “ You will breakfast with me , will you not , Morrel ? ” said the count , to turn the conversation .
“ Straw ! ” they all cried out , “ straw !
Remain , sir , ” he added to Aramis , who had moved to leave the room .
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE Chapter IX .
“ Dearest , dearest Valentine , ” exclaimed he , “ forgive me if I have offended you , and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain. ” “ No , Maximilian , I am not offended , ” answered she , “ but do you not see what a poor , helpless being I am , almost a stranger and an outcast in my father ’ s house , where even he is seldom seen ; whose will has been thwarted , and spirits broken , from the age of ten years , beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me ; oppressed , mortified , and persecuted , day by day , hour by hour , minute by minute , no person has cared for , even observed my sufferings , nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself .
“ Mount , my lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan to Mazarin , who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding .
“ Yes , that is the very boy ; he ’ s patronized by Bazin. ” “ Ah , yes , I know. ” “ Of what importance is this little reptile to you ? ” asked Porthos .
That would spoil my plans. ” “ Sir , ” said the gardener , glancing at the sun-dial , “ the ten minutes are almost up ; I must return to my post .
The prince was said to be in person at Bethune .
The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall , and at length , weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul , he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses , and the enchantment of his marvellous dream .
Then they were both silent .
I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance , to recover myself. ” Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection ; he not only extended his hand to the young man , but flew to him with open arms .
Come , your excellency , ” the count added , turning to Franz , “ here is Luigi Vampa , who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed. ” Franz approached , the chief advancing several steps to meet him .
Well , let me see , what can you want that begins with N ?
D ’ Artagnan , equally moved , pressed him also closely to him , whilst tears stood in his eyes .
They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose ; at length Valentine ventured .
At length , with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench , and found himself on his feet .
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the helm .
“ Then , ” replied M. de Villefort , “ have the kindness to wait half an hour ; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room .
“ Alas , ” said d ’ Avrigny , “ she is indeed dead , poor child ! ” 50099m “ Yes , ” answered the doctor laconically , dropping the sheet he had raised .
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses , they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation .
You have a park , and horses , servants. ” Athos smiled .
“ Here we are , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ it is only half-past ten o ’ clock , come in. ” “ Certainly , I will. ” “ My carriage shall take you back. ” “ No , thank you ; I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me. ” “ There it is , then , ” said Monte Cristo , as he stepped out of the carriage .
“ This is the point of departure ; it is a syllogism .
You have a friend , Monsieur du Vallon , whom I like much ; let him accompany you. ” “ The devil ! ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself .
I have tried to make you a happy man , and you have turned out a murderer. ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” said Caderousse , “ make one more attempt—try me once more ! ” “ I will , ” said the count .
It led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory .
“ It is very soon to leave me , ” he thought , “ but he follows the common custom .
Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown , whom he loved already ; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening , he would kill him with his water jug .
“ Well ? ” exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison .
Now the four friends began to speak loud , scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began , and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table .
Before he had spoken a word , the count saw in the next room a veiled woman , who had followed closely after Baptistin , and now , seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table , rushed in .
A mantle-piece , with two modern Sèvres vases , a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow , a mirror with an engraving on each side—one representing Homer carrying his guide , the other , Belisarius begging—a grayish paper ; red and black tapestry—such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore ’ s drawing-room .
Porthos was Discontented with his Condition .
Monsieur d ’ Artagnan is my tenant , although he does not pay me my rent—and even better on that account ought I to know him .
And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Château-Renaud , leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf .
“ Then steer for Monte Cristo. ” The captain gave his orders , the helm was put up , and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island .
De Winter followed his look , observed his feelings , and guessed all .
The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward .
Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary ; in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon .
“ Yes , let us go to the library , please. ” The marquis took his arm , and they left the salon .
“ He is preparing a way for your majesty to escape .
I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall , that I mightn ’ t break my promise and strangle Grimaud. ” “ I doubt , however , ” said La Ramee , in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate , “ if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness. ” “ Pardieu !
“ Sir , ” said he to the priest , “ I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment .
“ Help ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
Three brigands , called Trestaillon , Truphemy , and Graffan , publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism .
All London was crowding to the doors of the house .
Have you not , happy rogue that you are—have you not your duchess , who can not fail to come to your aid ? ” “ Well , you see , my dear D ’ Artagnan , with what ill luck I play , ” replied Porthos , with the most careless air in the world .
“ The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen ? ” “ No. ” “ He looked to me—but ’ tis impossible. ” At this instant the sergeant , who had been for his orders , returned , and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks , said : “ The passports are in order ; let these three gentlemen pass. ” The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission .
They passed through two rooms , furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini , and were shown into an elegantly fitted-up drawing-room .
Fatality .
We may like bouillotte , delight in whist , be enraptured with boston , and yet grow tired of them all ; but we always come back to _écarté_—it is not only a game , it is a _hors-d ’ œuvre_ !
He struck his forehead on the ground and groaned .
“ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan !
Villefort , Franz , and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary .
I went to him and told him all ; he knew me , that man did , and did not doubt an instant .
“ To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow ?
“ Oblige me by taking a seat , ” said D ’ Artagnan , pushing a chair toward Mordaunt , who sat down , pale but calm .
Thank him , then , my child , in your very best manner ; for , had he not come to our aid , neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks. ” The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner , saying , “ He ’ s too ugly. ” 20353m The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes , while Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed .
“ A _rondeau ! _ ” said the curate , mechanically .
It must have been the devil who taught it you , was it not ? ” Mordaunt replied by trying his opponent ’ s weapon with an amount of strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble ; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt had just achieved , he succeeded in meeting his sword , which slid along his own without touching his chest .
The procurator ’ s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room , and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation .
He remained motionless , but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury .
All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy , between life and death , which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next—a sublime spot , a resting-place full of poetry and character , and at which Franz had already halted five or six times , and at each time found it more marvellous and striking .
There ’ s only the price we are not agreed about. ’ “ ‘ How not agreed about ? ’ said Caderousse .
Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them .
But now hasten on board , I will join you there ere long. ” So saying , the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies , and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de Justice .
“ You promise to become one of the lights of the Church .
Say to her : ‘ Peace or war !
This wine will give you strength , drink ! ” And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman , who drank mechanically .
Beside his taste for the fine arts , which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude , he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm , was often angry and capricious , and always sarcastic .
“ And , sir , ” continued the wounded man , “ I suffer much and would like , if possible , to be carried to some house. ” “ Where you can be relieved ? ” asked De Guiche .
I know something of him. ” “ But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him. ” “ Fortune is a courtesan ; favorable yesterday , she may turn her back tomorrow. ” “ Which means that you now hesitate ? ” “ No , I do not hesitate ; God forbid !
Besides , the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me , at least entirely , as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That .
You know there are different sorts. ” “ That tall , harsh-looking man is very learned , he discovered , in the neighborhood of Rome , a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have , and he immediately laid his discovery before the Institute .
In case I am killed , the captain ’ s name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning .
From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife ? ” “ From Monsieur Laporte. ” “ Did he give you any details ? ” “ He knew none himself. ” “ And you have learned nothing from any other quarter ? ” “ Yes , I have received— ” “ What ? ” “ I fear I am committing a great imprudence. ” “ You always come back to that ; but I must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat. ” “ I do not retreat , _mordieu ! _ ” cried the citizen , swearing in order to rouse his courage .
An idiot , who held the life of Lord de Winter in his hands and did not kill him , by which I missed three hundred thousand livres ’ income. ” “ That ’ s true , ” said Kitty ; “ your son was the only heir of his uncle , and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune. ” D ’ Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him , with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation , for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses .
“ Yes ; see , I send a ball into the moat ; a man is there who picks it up ; the ball contains a letter .
The point was , then , to discover the hidden entrance .
At the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his .
“ And I say that murders _are_ committed here , ” said Morrel , whose voice , though lower in tone , lost none of its terrible distinctness : “ I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months .
“ There ; do you see , madame , he recognizes you , and bows. ” The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner .
As things are turning out , I foresee that we must give battle to London , to the provinces , to all England , and certainly in the end we can ’ t fail to be beaten. ” “ We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene , ” said Athos .
What unforseen events might not open his prison door , and restore him to liberty ?
“ Who goes there ? ” was asked a second time .
Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated ? ” “ Oh yes , I read it over three times , and the words sank deeply into my memory. ” “ Repeat it to me. ” Dantès paused a moment , then said , “ This is it , word for word : ‘ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion , that one Edmond Dantès , mate on board the _Pharaon_ , this day arrived from Smyrna , after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo , has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper ; again , by the usurper , with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris .
He had a deep-set , penetrating eye , almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow , and a long ( and still black ) beard reaching down to his breast .
The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass , and called his sergeant .
Grimaud shook his head negatively .
No .
“ Yes , yes , ” said La Ramee , “ the matter concerns you , for you will have the honor to serve us ; and besides , however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst , there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles , and that something will be yours. ” Grimaud bowed in thanks .
The sergeant drew near to Planchet .
50275m “ Oh , thank me again ! ” said the count ; “ tell me till you are weary , that I have restored you to happiness ; you do not know how much I require this assurance. ” “ Oh , yes , yes , I thank you with all my heart , ” said Valentine ; “ and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude , oh , then , ask Haydée !
“ And besides , ” he said , “ going out of this chamber isn ’ t all. ” “ Dear friend , ” said Porthos , “ you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to-day than you were yesterday .
how can you tell me that ? ” “ Does that alarm you ? ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
“ Then you love me ? ” said she .

“ Yes ; but your father died in your arms , happy , respected , rich , and full of years ; his father died poor , despairing , almost doubtful of Providence ; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards , his tomb had disappeared , and no one could say , ‘ There sleeps the father you so well loved. ’ ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed Morrel .
When this operation was complete , he invited her to descend by offering her his hand .
Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement .
Courted by my step-mother , who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom ; admired by my father , who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed ; idolized by Edward , who , notwithstanding his fear of the count ’ s large black eyes , runs to meet him the moment he arrives , and opens his hand , in which he is sure to find some delightful present , —M .
Sometimes in the midst of dinner , when everyone , under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation , believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table , Aramis looked at his watch , arose with a bland smile , and took leave of the company , to go , as he said , to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment .
“ But , ” continued Morcerf , “ _à propos_ of Danglars , —we have strangely wandered from the subject .
The carriage , however , passed on .
Now , then , all is agreed ; let us go down. ” “ You are going into the garden ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Go along this corridor , down a little staircase , and you are in it. ” “ Excellent ; thank you ! ” And the two women parted , exchanging charming smiles .
A million ?
“ What is his bearing ? ” Mordaunt hesitated ; but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth .
“ Her brother ? ” replied Athos .
The count , in his survey of the pit , encountered a pale face and threatening eyes , which evidently sought to gain his attention .
Well-a-day !
“ But we must be going. ” The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris , followed by Mousqueton , who , after being too cold all night , at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm .
“ We are for the king and the princes , ” added Athos .
“ What a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar .
Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him , and led her respectfully back to the door .
“ My cloak—stop up the aperture with it. ” “ Why ? ” asked Blaisois .
I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my eyes .
“ To wait , ” replied Athos .
And yet , as he journeyed along , a profound sadness weighed upon his heart .
Left alone , D ’ Artagnan read and reread his billet .
“ Yes , yes , ” said Felton ; “ I understand how he would act .
And what did the officers do ? ” “ Four conveyed him away , I don ’ t know where—to the Bastille or Fort l ’ Evêque .
Albert ’ s lips scarcely whispered “ Good-bye , ” but his look was more explicit ; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger , proud disdain , and generous indignation .
Go out by the door , turn to the right , jump into your saddles , all will be right ; don ’ t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal .
Do you hear it ?
D ’ Artagnan pursued his way .
One thing , however , reassured him ; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off , and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders .
The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse , not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen ’ s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure .
Has such and such a perfume done anything for me ?
When the soldier saluted Charles , Athos ’ s heart bounded for joy ; and that unfortunate , on coming to himself , found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his pocket .
D ’ Artagnan needs to be alone , to weep and to sleep .
I was there , too , and I never shall forget the old man ’ s smile at this prescription .
“ Oh , ” said she , seizing the count ’ s hand and raising it to her lips ; “ oh , thank you , thank you , Edmond !
“ Well , sir , ” said Morrel , sinking into a chair , “ you have heard all , and I have nothing further to tell you. ” “ I see , ” returned the Englishman , “ that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you , and this only increases my desire to serve you. ” “ Oh , sir ! ” cried Morrel .
“ Listen , ” said she ; “ I yield to your protestations , I yield to your assurances .
HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS The most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly D ’ Artagnan , although he , in his quality of Guardsman , would be much more easily equipped than Messieurs the Musketeers , who were all of high rank ; but our Gascon cadet was , as may have been observed , of a provident and almost avaricious character , and with that ( explain the contradiction ) so vain as almost to rival Porthos .
In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved. ” “ Everything shall be done as you say , Athos .
“ To how much ? ” said she .
A gentleman , who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin , was seated at the same table , and was breakfasting .
But this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man , and was succeeded by a still greater grief .
“ What , ” he stammered , “ do you mean to keep that money ?
Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish , and perhaps , too , who knows , some friends to reward .
“ See , ” said she , “ if everything does not second us !
At the sound of that carriage I shuddered ; soon I heard steps on the staircase , which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan .
“ Alas !
We will not go till evening. ” This very much astonished the sailors , although , not one opposed it .
I am not a priest. ” “ You are not a priest ! ” cried the executioner .
Groslow began turning the cards one after another .
Chapter XI .
D ’ Artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it .
“ You do not understand ? ” asked Felton .
He was less stiff than formerly .
As you see , my health is but indifferent .
Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary .
A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures .
“ You will see , ” said the man proudly ; “ in five minutes he will speak. ” “ I have , then , five minutes , ” said Monte Cristo to himself ; “ it is more time than I require .
Porthos , in order to make a greater display , had that evening borrowed Planchet .
To-day the third will be there also. ” “ As long as they are in prison all will be well , ” said Anne , “ but one of these days they will get out. ” “ Yes , if your majesty releases them. ” “ Ah ! ” exclaimed Anne , following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions , “ one regrets Paris ! ” “ Why so ? ” “ On account of the Bastile , sir , which is so strong and so secure. ” “ Madame , these conferences will bring us peace ; when we have peace we shall regain Paris ; with Paris , the Bastile , and our four bullies shall rot therein. ” Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin , in taking leave , kissed her hand .
Faith !
Tell him also what you have just told me—that Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit , and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity. ” “ Which can not last , ” interrupted Comminges ; “ the cardinal said so ; there is no prison here. ” “ But there are oubliettes ! ” replied Athos , smiling .
We will hasten on to the inn ; you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor .
I will sit facing Stuart , whom I like so much to see , especially where he now is , and you , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , opposite to me. ” Athos turned red with rage .
I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me , and even to remain faithful to my memory .
They promised , upon separating , to meet at the Duke of Bracciano ’ s ball , to which all Rome was invited .
Are you then making a thesis ? ” “ Without doubt , ” replied the Jesuit .
At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people .
“ And what did he say to you ? ” “ Asked me questions about the vessel , the time she left Marseilles , the course she had taken , and what was her cargo .
Gloves of gray kid , matching the hat , well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand ; whilst his boots , similar in color to the hat and gloves , confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old .
“ Well , now , my dear Gérard , ” said he to the young man , with a very significant look , “ do you know , you seem as if you were not very glad to see me ? ” “ My dear father , ” said Villefort , “ I am , on the contrary , delighted ; but I so little expected your visit , that it has somewhat overcome me. ” “ But , my dear fellow , ” replied M. Noirtier , seating himself , “ I might say the same thing to you , when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February , and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris. ” “ And if I have come , my dear father , ” said Gérard , drawing closer to M. Noirtier , “ do not complain , for it is for you that I came , and my journey will be your salvation. ” “ Ah , indeed ! ” said M. Noirtier , stretching himself out at his ease in the chair .
Chapter 104 .
Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive , sudden , and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf , Danglars , and Villefort .
“ My dear Mistress Turquaine , ” said the Gascon , “ if you happen to have any money , lock it up quickly ; if you happen to have any jewels , hide them directly ; if you happen to have any debtors , make them pay you , or any creditors , don ’ t pay them. ” “ Why , prithee ? ” asked Madeleine .
my house ? ” “ Oh , your excellency , it was not yours , then. ” “ Whose , then ?
But D ’ Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age , dressed simply , but in perfect taste , entered the room , raising , as he came , his hat , adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers .
But are you seriously wounded ?
When at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn , a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath ; then , fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular expression , the dying man uttered the last death-rattle and expired .
Monte Cristo approached the window , and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight .
Realizing this , Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister , instead of aiding to crush him .
What for ? —that they may try , a month hence , to marry me again ; and to whom ? —M .
Egad !
“ My dear fellow , I think we should ask you that question ; you know such news much better than we do .
Ah , my head ! —Oh , what agony ! —Shall I suffer like this long ? ” “ No , no , friend , ” replied the doctor , “ you will soon cease to suffer. ” “ Ah , I understand you , ” said the unhappy man .
Mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven .
Suddenly D ’ Artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed ; but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before .
As Athos and Aramis proceeded , and passed different companies on the road , they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle .
The major will bring his son with him this evening , the _contino_ , as we say in Italy ; he confides him to my care .
How can a young man live upon 5,000 francs a month ? ” “ But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more—— ” “ Do not advance it ; the father will never repay it .
Morrel , in a corner of the carriage , allowed his brother-in-law ’ s gayety to expend itself in words , while he felt equal inward joy , which , however , betrayed itself only in his countenance .
come , one may easily see , vicomte , that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him .
“ Well , then , we will put simply , _My Lord , do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared ? _ ” “ My dear D ’ Artagnan , you will never make anything but a very bad secretary .
The poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended .
At that moment I encountered the eye of the prince .
At ten o ’ clock in the evening , it is well known , the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented .
At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder .
There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards .
“ Because , madame , it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted—-that is , that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands. ” “ And that valor would shrink from no undertaking , according to what I see. ” “ It has hesitated at nothing in the past ; why , then , should it be less daring in the future ? ” “ Then , in case of my refusal , this valor , should a struggle occur , will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court , to deliver me into the hands of the Fronde , as you propose to deliver my minister ? ” “ We have not thought about it yet , madame , ” answered D ’ Artagnan , with that Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete ; “ but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly. ” “ I ought , ” muttered Anne to herself , “ by this time to remember that these men are giants. ” “ Alas , madame ! ” exclaimed D ’ Artagnan , “ this proves to me that not till to-day has your majesty had a just idea of us. ” “ Perhaps , ” said Anne ; “ but that idea , if at last I have it—— ” “ Your majesty will do us justice .
I should be carried home in triumph like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus .
But to her great surprise D ’ Artagnan remained perfectly calm , and instead of being angry he laughed , and said to Porthos : “ Yes , I understand , the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of Pierrefonds ; but console yourself , I will soon conduct you to one much better. ” “ When will you do that ? ” “ Immediately , I hope. ” “ Ah !
“ Only I concealed a glass of water , which remained after my breakfast , thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained forty-eight hours without eating or drinking .
Besides this , as every great action bears its recompense with it , the brave exploit of D ’ Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost .
He recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him , and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand , he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard .
“ I can not make you share the fate I have planned for myself .
But , as we have said , D ’ Artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty .
He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it .
I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust .
“ What is that ? ” said he ; “ whence comes that cry ? ” “ From the wounded man ’ s room , ” replied the host .
I went too ; but as I was older than Fernand , and had just married my poor wife , I was only sent to the coast .
At this moment the coadjutor was announced ; a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage .
Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you ; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father , now a madman , and her brother who died last September with his mother .
“ Is it by permission that he remains there ? ” asked Gondy .
I know well , demon , that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past , and that you have read , by the light of what torch I know not , every page of my life ; but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings .
Mazarin made a grimace , as if he meant to say , “ But he does not wear the cardinal ’ s cap ; ” then he added : “ So , my friend , it ’ s your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will escape ? ” “ That ’ s my idea , my lord ; and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes , I should refuse it .
D ’ Artagnan , who had just dismounted , then saw , outlined against the wall , the enormous stomach of Mousqueton , whose down-drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress .
In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil , near me , under my own eyes , within reach of my hand , the two most intractable ones .
At this challenge , Vampa rose quickly , drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle .
You do not understand the points of English horses. ” The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity .
But now we are alone , —although it is immaterial to me , —where are we going ? ” “ Into Normandy , if you like. ” “ Delightful ; shall we be quite retired ?
I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds ; I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood ; on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who were in danger , and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took away .
At the end of the jetty , his clothes richly laced with gold , glittering , as was customary with him , with diamonds and precious stones , his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder , Buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself .
“ Not with us , sir , ” replied Dantès .
You are rich then , my dear Monsieur Bonacieux ? ” “ I am comfortably off , monsieur , that ’ s all ; I have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business , but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet ; so that you understand , monsieur—But ! — ” cried the citizen .
This secret which he possessed , this woman whom he loved !
What could I do for you , Edmond , besides pray and weep ?
A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement , as the cardinal had predicted , the last trace of her resentment disappeared , if not from her heart , at least from her countenance .
“ Advance , gentlemen , ” said the cardinal .
He spoke of me to Lord de Winter , already prejudiced against me , and told him that his sister-in-law was a prostitute , a branded woman .
At ten o ’ clock Anne of Austria had entered the king ’ s room .
“ All right , all right , ” said the jailer ; “ all right , since you will have it so .
When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton approaching .
They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join them .
“ Well , pray , is there anything to be so surprised at ? ” he said .
That ’ s where we are .
“ A truce to compliments , ” said Aramis ; “ we want to see the coadjutor , and instantly , as we are in haste. ” “ Certainly , sir—it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante-chamber , only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bruy. ” “ De Bruy ! ” cried the friends , “ ’ tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening , ” said Aramis , “ so we give it up. ” And they hastened to quit the palace , followed by Bazin , who was lavish of bows and compliments .
Help me , —lend me your assistance ! ” Noirtier looked at the dictionary .
That pretty little _soubrette_ whom D ’ Artagnan had already observed then came in .
Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey ’ s visits .
“ Assassin of Buckingham , assassin of Felton , assassin of my brother , I demand justice upon you , and I swear that if it be not granted to me , I will execute it myself. ” And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of D ’ Artagnan , leaving the place free for another accuser .
At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open. ” “ And the monk ? ” exclaimed the executioner , “ did you see the monk ? ” “ What monk ? ” “ The monk that was shut in with me. ” “ No , he was no longer here ; he appears to have fled by the window .
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter ! ” “ Oh , Heaven !
“ In short , ” continued the cardinal , “ as I have heard nothing of you for some time past , I wished to know what you were doing .
“ A capital blow you gave ! ” cried Porthos .
His reflections were not very cheerful .
The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised .
A double movement of the globe he inhabited , and of which he could feel nothing , appeared to him perfectly impossible .
“ No , it has been stolen from you. ” “ Stolen ?
To this dumb language , which was so unintelligible to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration , united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses .
But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance , which nevertheless ought not to be omitted ; in one of the rooms he crossed , the _trousseau_ of the bride-elect was on exhibition .
“ Oho ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , as he went down the steps of the hatchway , preceded by the lantern , “ what a number of barrels !
the favorite , the confidant , the first man , in short , at the court , he had been obliged to yield his place to Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor ; and eventually , as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position , the queen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant , who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again .
“ There is a carriage coming , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ How do I know ?
Another Queen in Want of Help .
“ Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter , which I have just received ? ” said the astonished Athos .
“ Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation. ” “ Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and I have noticed that—— ” “ What ? ” “ That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform. ” “ You have evidently seen and observed everything. ” “ Let us proceed. ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Now as regards the second question. ” “ I am listening. ” “ Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès ? ” “ Yes ; a young man who loved her. ” “ And his name was—— ” “ Fernand. ” “ That is a Spanish name , I think ? ” “ He was a Catalan. ” “ You imagine him capable of writing the letter ? ” “ Oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me. ” “ That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never. ” “ Besides , ” said Dantès , “ the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him. ” “ You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? ” “ To no one. ” “ Not even to your mistress ? ” “ No , not even to my betrothed. ” “ Then it is Danglars. ” “ I feel quite sure of it now. ” “ Wait a little .
And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there ?
In the meantime D ’ Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne , where he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette .
Then take pistols with thee and a hunting-knife. ” “ Are we then going to travel , my lord ? ” asked Mousqueton , rather uneasy .
It was not possible , as he knew well , to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV. , especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age .
Happen what will , the devil take them , they can ’ t eat us. ” And he mounted his horse .
The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it .
Speak , gentlemen , speak—I am listening ; conceal nothing , gloss over nothing .
oh ! ” said Porthos , “ there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ Bah !
Take the hundred pistoles , my friend ; take the hundred pistoles ! ” D ’ Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied .
It was chance that threw me in your way ; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends. ” “ One of your friends ? ” interrupted Mme .
He ordered the carriage , therefore , for eleven o ’ clock , desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel .
Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself .
D ’ Artagnan , on his side , went up to the landlady , praised her wine—which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil—and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village ; one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris , and was at that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville ; the other was a convent of Jesuits and was the property—a by no means unusual circumstance—of these worthy fathers .
Those who would , as it were , force a passage to his heart , found an impassable barrier .
D ’ Artagnan , as we have said , perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase .
he has grown a good deal , it seems to me. ” And he sat down in the hall , choosing a conspicuous place .
“ What does the animal say ? ” asked the duke .
“ Have you proof of this ? ” “ I had it. ” “ And you have lost it ; how stupid ! ” “ Yes ; but by careful search it might be recovered. ” “ Really , ” returned the count , “ relate it to me , for it begins to interest me. ” And the count , humming an air from _Lucia_ , went to sit down on a bench , while Bertuccio followed him , collecting his thoughts .
You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door. ” “ Go , sir , ” said the queen ; “ I will follow you. ” D ’ Artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box .
But would you believe that I purchase all this delight , joy , and happiness , for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life , at the small cost of 500 francs per annum , paid quarterly ?
It would require years to do again what I have done here , and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other .
“ You see , then , ” said Albert , “ that instead of opposing , she will encourage me. ” “ Adieu , then , until five o ’ clock ; be punctual , and we shall arrive at twelve or one. ” “ At Tréport ? ” “ Yes ; or in the neighborhood. ” “ But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours ? ” “ Easily , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I dressed myself as quickly as possible ; my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated .
He did not look like an executioner. ” “ And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office ? ” “ But , ” said Mordaunt , “ it might have been some personal enemy of the king , who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way .
oh !
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath .
gentlemen !
Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant , or else dictated by venal ambition. ” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before .
Chapter XVIII .
“ I have charged myself with this affair .
Athos immediately profited by the permission , and the door was closed behind him .
They halted for a minute , during which he strove to collect his thoughts .
“ I reply , my lord , ’ tis but little , as certainly I shall not go alone. ” “ I suppose not .
At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword , and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer .
But Andrea , turning towards them , winked his eyes , rolled his tongue around his cheeks , and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent .
“ What is the prisoner doing ? ” inquired Vampa of the sentinel .
“ By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket. ” “ You see , then , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that I must have that letter .
Moreover , it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know , and believe nothing but what they should believe .
“ It is some time since we heard from his mistress , ” said Athos , in a low voice .
“ D ’ Artagnan , D ’ Artagnan ! ” cried she ; “ remember that I loved you ! ” The young man rose and took a step toward her .
One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet , took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat .
It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos , Aramis , and even the Englishman .
They were both aroused at seven o ’ clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant , who brought a letter for D ’ Artagnan .
“ Except that which I ask of you , dear love. ” “ But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness ? ” “ I can not wait till tomorrow. ” “ Silence !
The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me , but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends .
He will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity , which he will convert into prosperity .
By a violent effort he rose half out of the water , waving his cap , and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors .
He told us that the army was disbanded , and that he should return by Châteauroux , Clermont-Ferrand , Le Puy , and Nîmes ; and , if I had any money , he prayed me to leave it for him at Nîmes , with an innkeeper with whom I had dealings. ” “ In the smuggling line ? ” said Monte Cristo .
D ’ Artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years ’ standing .
“ For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual , but , on the fourth I heard nothing .
What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament ?
“ Ah , devil take it , you speak in earnest—— ” “ And must have a definite answer .
The groom cried aloud for help .
I told her my orders from M. Beauchamp ; she first extended her arms to prevent me , but after a moment ’ s reflection , ‘ Yes , go , Florentin , ’ said she , ‘ and may he come quickly. ’ ” “ Yes , my mother , ” said Albert , “ I will return , and woe to the infamous wretch !
It is you who surrendered the castle of Yanina !
But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , ” added he , drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies , “ I shall endeavor to correct his mistake. ” “ What happened during the night ? ” asked Beauchamp of Château-Renaud ; “ we appear to make a very sorry figure here. ” “ In truth , what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble , ” replied the baron .
Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge .
Ali alone was present to wait at table , and acquitted himself so admirably , that the guest complimented his host thereupon .
Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking , for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise ; and now , at the moment when I reckoned upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me .
The Viscount of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness. ” “ But two million francs make a nice little sum , ” replied Morcerf .
Tomorrow , then , monsieur—tomorrow. ” “ Till then , God preserve your Majesty ! ” However ill the king might sleep , M. de Tréville slept still worse .
27 , Rue du Helder , 21st May , half-past ten in the morning. ” “ Now then , ” said the count , returning his tablets to his pocket , “ make yourself perfectly easy ; the hand of your time-piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself. ” “ Shall I see you again ere my departure ? ” asked Albert .
As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants .
As to Aramis , he never played .
Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury , screaming in a formidable way .
The king has nothing like it. ” “ No , ” answered Porthos , “ I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal , Monsieur de Mazarin .
The count , however , has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days ’ rest , with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time , will bring them back to as fine , that is as terrifying , a condition as they were in yesterday .
Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it .
“ Then , ” answered the elder prisoner , “ the will of God be done ! ” And as the old man slowly pronounced those words , an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance .
M. de Tréville requested Athos , whatever might happen , to be observant of his duty to the king , but particularly to the queen , begging him to convey his desires to his comrades .
“ And now , ” demanded the count , “ are all the forms complied with ? ” “ All , sir. ” “ Have you the keys ? ” “ They are in the hands of the concierge , who takes care of the house , but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new possessions. ” “ Very well ; ” and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary , which said , “ I have no further need of you ; you may go. ” “ But , ” observed the honest notary , “ the count is , I think , mistaken ; it is only fifty thousand francs , everything included. ” “ And your fee ? ” “ Is included in this sum. ” “ But have you not come from Auteuil here ? ” “ Yes , certainly. ” “ Well , then , it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble , ” said the count ; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal .
What can I do ?
Two inches an hour does not seem much , but in twelve hours that makes two feet , and three we had before , that makes five .
Rochefort , all is not lost ; and perhaps—perhaps everything is for the best. ” “ The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminence ’ s genius— ” “ Will repair the blunders of his agent—is that it ? ” “ That is exactly what I was going to say , if your Eminence had let me finish my sentence. ” “ Meanwhile , do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of Buckingham are now concealed ? ” “ No , monseigneur ; my people could tell me nothing on that head. ” “ But I know. ” “ You , monseigneur ? ” “ Yes ; or at least I guess .
“ Look well at me ! ” said Monte Cristo , putting the light near his face .
“ ‘ It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow , ’ said he ; ‘ I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you .
You go , leaving me in all the horror of my situation , after increasing it by what you have revealed to me .
“ Thomson & French , ” said he ; “ do you know this house , monsieur ? ” 20253m “ They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world , ” returned the count quietly .
He was in a most elegant hunting costume ; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him .
The lion was daunted ; the avenger was conquered .
The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades , and I have heard nothing of either of them since .
Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever shown you—a frank and honorable countenance. ” To this flow of words , not perhaps in the best taste , but characteristic of D ’ Artagnan , whose principal object was to divert his opponent ’ s attention , Mordaunt did not reply , but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with D ’ Artagnan .
D ’ Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past eight .
At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier d ’ Herblay , Charles opened his eyes , and raising his noble head , in spite of himself , threw a glance at all the actors in the scene .
Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me .
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been , and was now to find out what the man had become .
The Workmen .
He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him .
I was no longer in the house where I had dwelt .
As we said before , by ten o ’ clock almost all the guests had dispersed ; those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o ’ clock to one at Cours la Reine .
I do not , madame , ” rejoined Mazarin .
His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Albert ’ s grief-stricken face , who approached also , followed by the other four young men .
So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were .
I want to be enlightened on a subject ; then , when I shall have learned what I desire to know , I will withdraw. ” “ Be enlightened ! ” said Athos , phlegmatically .
“ I pray for it , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
My place of abode is No .
I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself , had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul .
He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the treasures .
“ I understand now why they murdered him. ” Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man , whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold .
The treasure will be no more mine than yours , and neither of us will quit this prison .
Since you now know my face , I wish to be remembered alone through the affection I hope you will grant me .
The poor girl ventured a glance at D ’ Artagnan which said , “ See how I suffer on your account ! ” Toward the end of the evening , however , the beautiful lioness became milder ; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of D ’ Artagnan , and even gave him her hand to kiss .
Kitty ’ s detention was not long .
“ With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping , you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so. ” La Ramee laughed .
A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning ; but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly .
Each was accompanied by two priests .
“ Yes , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ the door was towards the road before , and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road , I remember. ” “ Yes , madame , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate. ” “ In four days , ” said Morrel ; “ it is extraordinary ! ” “ Indeed , ” said Château-Renaud , “ it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one ; for it was very old , and dull too .
That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan .
Edmond , my friend , do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart .
“ How should he have been otherwise ?
The queen stretched out her hand , seized the ring , pressed it convulsively to her lips—and without being able to breathe a sigh , to give vent to a sob , she extended her arms , became deadly pale , and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter .
At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot .
Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida .
Her crimes , I know them not ; her disorders , I know them not ; her vices , I know them not .
“ You are thoughtful , sir , ” continued Morrel ; “ you want something ; shall I call one of the servants ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
M. de Tréville , who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection , never ceased recommending him to the king .
Speak quickly , friend. ” The man said , in a low voice : “ I wish—I wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris .
“ Dantès is my friend , and I won ’ t have him ill-used. ” “ And who thinks of using him ill ?
A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly .
I wish to be sure of my revenge .
and do you never use your eyes , which must have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty , to divine , at a glance , the kind of man by whom you are confronted ?
“ I have seen Russians devour , without being visibly inconvenienced , vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab. ” “ And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the East , and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison ? ” “ Certainly ; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed. ” “ Yes , I understand that ; and how would you habituate yourself , for instance , or rather , how did you habituate yourself to it ? ” “ Oh , very easily .
The whole establishment had been changed ; another valet was engaged for himself , a new servant for Noirtier , two women had entered Madame de Villefort ’ s service , —in fact , everywhere , to the concierge and coachmen , new faces were presented to the different masters of the house , thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family .
Just then the door opened , and the jailer , addressing himself to Bertuccio , said : “ Excuse me , sir , but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner. ” “ And so closes our interview , ” said Andrea to the worthy steward ; “ I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil ! ” “ I will return tomorrow , ” said Bertuccio .
“ The deed , if you please , Mr. Notary. ” And he signed it rapidly , after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors .
It will be a splendid session ! ” Chapter 100 .
“ Another ? ” “ And a magnificent one ! ” cried the host .
But D ’ Artagnan , still keeping on the defensive , drew near to Kitty ’ s door .
The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most delightful in Rome , the duchess , one of the last heiresses of the Colonnas , does its honors with the most consummate grace , and thus their _fêtes_ have a European celebrity .
The coast , owing to the Gascon ’ s stratagem , was clear .
Involuntarily his languid eyes closed , and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped .
“ The marriage will take place in less than three months , ” said Villefort .
“ And have you any recollection of your country ? ” “ When I shut my eyes and think , I seem to see it all again .
The Abbé ’ s Chamber After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage , which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor , into which the abbé ’ s cell opened ; from that point the passage became much narrower , and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees .
But really , my dear count , we are talking as much of women as they do of us ; it is unpardonable. ” Albert rose .
“ Really , my dear Gondy , ” said the duchess , “ you remind one of the Apocalypse .
“ I love to see you thus .
confound it ! ” cried the Gascon , trying in vain , too late , to retract the thrust .
It is not Fernand Mondego ’ s treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you , but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you , and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its consequences ; and I say , and proclaim it publicly , that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father , and I , his son , thank you for not using greater severity. ” Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene , it would not have surprised them more than did Albert ’ s declaration .
“ Take this peach , then , ” she said .
“ Reload the muskets , Grimaud , ” said Athos , “ and we , gentlemen , will go on with our breakfast , and resume our conversation .
The oval face was lengthened , his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution ; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought ; his eyes were full of melancholy , and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred ; his complexion , so long kept from the sun , had now that pale color which produces , when the features are encircled with black hair , the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north ; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression ; and he had also acquired , being naturally of a goodly stature , that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself .
I was not so in my youth , I was not so on the night of the betrothal , when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles .
Besides , it began to grow late , and then , as today , people went to bed early in the quarter of the Luxembourg .
Well , then , read this paper , which I have never shown to anyone. ” “ Tomorrow , my dear friend , ” said Edmond , desirous of not yielding to the old man ’ s madness .
Beppo got in , inviting the Frenchman to follow him , and he did not wait to be asked twice .
When I returned to Paris , I learned that you , the widow of M. de Nargonne , had married M. Danglars .
It was not to meet me that he came , for he was ignorant of my journey .
At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever , and when they parted , each to take the route agreed on , they turned back to utter affectionate expressions , which the echoes of the Dunes repeated .
I have begun a poem in verses of one syllable .
The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men .
If you are not located in the United States , you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook .
They have allowed all this time to elapse , and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal , in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position .
You will charge Broussel to report it .
I am only annoyed about a bankrupt of Trieste. ” “ Really ?
Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts ; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos , which the besieged himself demolished .
But unfortunately I must wait. ” 40138m “ You must wait for what ? ” asked Caderousse .
The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity ; his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face .
At a quarter to six o ’ clock , Monsieur de Gondy , having finished his business , returned to the archiepiscopal palace .
He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines , and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him .
“ At the same time , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , “ notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year , and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year , it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage , hey ? ” “ Yes indeed , ” said Porthos .
Instead of taking the waters of Forges , I go and take sea waters ; I am free to do so .
After a brief silence , rendered still more solemn by the time and place , the count said , in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner : “ In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination ( the last we shall ever hold upon this subject ) , I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips of the Abbé Busoni .
what ’ s the matter at the Château d ’ If ? ” said the captain .
Providence is now opposed to them , when I most thought it would be propitious .
We shall not interfere with each other—your object is a title ; mine , money .
“ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , ” said the commissary , addressing Athos , “ declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur. ” “ But , ” cried Bonacieux , “ this is not Monsieur d ’ Artagnan whom you show me. ” “ What !
“ Very well , take Blaisois , with whom I know not what to do , since I already have Grimaud. ” “ Willingly , ” said Aramis .
The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil , and that he only knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni , who that evening , by mere chance , had requested to pass the night in his house , to examine some valuable books in his library .
He was , we repeat , handsome , young , and bold ; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return .
brave as you are and strong as you are , you could not kill them all. ” “ ’ Tis true , ” answered Porthos , rising on his saddle , in order that he might appraise the immense crowd , “ there are a lot of them. ” “ I think I should like the other fellow better than this one , ” said Mazarin to himself , and he threw himself back in his carriage .
Have they not obeyed me ? ” “ It is done ; as your Excellency may have observed , your horse is in the great gateway , ready saddled for your departure. ” “ That is well ; do as I have directed you , then. ” “ What the devil ! ” said the host to himself .
He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort , and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to London .
The duke had thrown himself , as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation , on his bed .
Ah , I am an unfortunate king , Monsieur de Tréville !
Cromwell ’ s House .
Take care of the executioner , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ All right .
Lean a little to the left .
The young girl smiled .
In an instant we were on the alert , but it was too late ; our vessel was surrounded , and amongst the custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes , and , as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other , I sprang into the hold , opened a port , and dropped into the river , dived , and only rose at intervals to breathe , until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the Rhône to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes .
He shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future .
The misfortune is great ; but I think you have still a good number of falcons , sparrow hawks , and tiercels. ” “ And not a man to instruct them .
Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat , manned by six or eight men , who have surprised and plundered it , some dark and stormy night , near some desert and gloomy island , as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest. ” “ But , ” asked Franz , who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat , “ why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French , Sardinian , or Tuscan governments ? ” “ Why ? ” said Gaetano with a smile .
“ Ah , I shall know how to make you leave your home ! ” replied Albert , clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove , which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of .
“ It was about one of those purchases that interest women—a purchase by which much might have been gained. ” But the more the young woman excused herself , the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him .
A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room , and went to open the door himself .
“ Darling , ” replied Valentine , “ has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words : “ ‘ _Wait and hope_ ( Fac et spera ) ! ’ ” FOOTNOTES : [ 1 ] “ The wicked are great drinkers of water ; As the flood proved once for all. ” [ 2 ] $ 2,600,000 in 1894 .
“ I can see nobody , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
I was promised he should die with me .
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte .
If you be a priest , I conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man ; if you be not , it is a different matter , and I warn you in the name of courtesy , of which you appear profoundly ignorant , that I shall chastise you for your insolence. ” The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange , that Raoul , whose eyes were still fixed upon him , felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult .
“ These gentlemen , Comminges , are not prisoners , ” returned Mazarin , with his ironical smile , “ only guests ; but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors , that they may not refuse to continue my visitors .
Are you sure you are more reasonable ? ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine ; “ and I have but one scruple , —that of leaving my dear grandmother ’ s remains , which I had undertaken to watch. ” “ Valentine , ” said Morrel , “ death is in itself sacred. ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine ; “ besides , it will not be for long. ” She then crossed the corridor , and led the way down a narrow staircase to M. Noirtier ’ s room ; Morrel followed her on tiptoe ; at the door they found the old servant .
The king , excited by the cardinal , made a terrible clamor .
In four days ’ time the shore will be beneath your feet , the sea will be open to you—more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you , for in four days England will be relieved of you. ” Milady folded her hands , and raising her fine eyes toward heaven , “ Lord , Lord , ” said she , with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone , “ pardon this man , as I myself pardon him. ” “ Yes , pray , accursed woman ! ” cried the baron ; “ your prayer is so much the more generous from your being , I swear to you , in the power of a man who will never pardon you ! ” and he went out .
“ So , then , ” said he , “ the letter was true to the end ? ” “ Did you doubt it , my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo ? ” “ No , indeed ; certainly not ; a good man , a man holding religious office , as does the Abbé Busoni , could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke ; but your excellency has not read all. ” “ Ah , true , ” said Monte Cristo “ there is a postscript. ” “ Yes , yes , ” repeated the major , “ yes—there—is—a—postscript. ” “ ‘ In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker , I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling expenses , and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs , which you still owe me. ’ ” The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript , apparently with great anxiety .
“ Are you ill ? ” “ Sir , I am very hungry , ” replied Mouston .
“ Oh , my friends , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ you come once more to save my life , not only mine but that of these gentlemen .
Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself ?
Then , too , my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity ; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity , no one could oppose him ; he is all-powerful even with the king ; he would crush you at a word .
S ’ blood !
The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder ; and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left Gaza .
Upon that , Athos yielded .
“ I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some horrible ‘ oubliettes ’ constructed. ” “ Oh !
his father ! ” “ Yes , his father , ” replied the abbé ; “ his right name was Noirtier de Villefort. ” At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès , and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before .
We must , then , as it appears to me , travel in company .
“ Now , sir , ” said Albert , “ if you think my apology sufficient , pray give me your hand .
Chapter II .
So much do I esteem them that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit , that I may converse with him tete-a-tete , and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him , as I said before , to the pavilion of the orangery ; that , you know , is my daily promenade .
He entered with a tolerably dignified step , and some little haste .
London .
There is a way of detecting its presence .
Afterward ? ” “ Afterward ?
Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty ?
Besides , it doesn ’ t concern me ; it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon. ” “ Ah , that is true , ” said Athos .
I will ask the cardinal. ” “ It was the cardinal , then , who informed you of this fête ? ” “ Yes , madame , ” replied the astonished king ; “ but why do you ask that ? ” “ It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs ? ” “ That is to say , madame— ” “ It was he , sire , it was he ! ” “ Well , and what does it signify whether it was he or I ?
Replace him on his orange horse , and let him begone ! ” “ Not before I have killed you , poltroon ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , making the best face possible , and never retreating one step before his three assailants , who continued to shower blows upon him .
“ Certainly ; and on the other hand , my lord , you have lost it , and now , in accordance with the law of war , sir , you must buy it back again. ” Mazarin felt a shiver run through him—a chill even to his heart ’ s core .
“ That is not probable. ” “ It is possible , ” said Milady .
“ Is , then , all that I have heard really true ? ” she inquired .
“ Let it come , ” said Athos .
“ Look at the arms. ” The sergeant put the lantern near the panel .
In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night , and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before .
“ Well , that is not impossible .
Wait ! ” And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on .
Cavalcanti ’ s father will be gone. ” “ But the son will be here ; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti ? ” “ I do not know him , viscount. ” “ You do not know him ? ” “ No , I never saw him until a few days since , and am not responsible for him. ” “ But you receive him at your house ? ” “ That is another thing : he was recommended to me by a good abbé , who may be deceived .
But neither of these two wounds was serious , and they only fought more earnestly .
“ Yes , your excellency ; he came from Marseilles , where he had been deputy procureur .
“ No , ” replied Morcerf , “ my father is most anxious about it ; and I hope , ere long , to introduce you , if not to my wife , at least to my betrothed—Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars. ” “ Eugénie Danglars , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ tell me , is not her father Baron Danglars ? ” “ Yes , ” returned Morcerf , “ a baron of a new creation. ” “ What matter , ” said Monte Cristo “ if he has rendered the State services which merit this distinction ? ” “ Enormous ones , ” answered Beauchamp .
“ I thought as much , ” said D ’ Artagnan , wasting his strength in useless efforts .
“ Because we want to know , ” said De Guiche , haughtily .
That ’ s well .
D ’ Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned , but he had disappeared .
A CONJUGAL SCENE As Athos had foreseen , it was not long before the cardinal came down .
“ If I call , come , ” said he .
His lackey , who , by an unforeseen piece of ill luck , had quarreled with the officers , disguised as stable lads— ” “ Miserable scoundrel ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ you were all in the plot , then !
“ said Monte Cristo “ You do not appear to be in the possession of your senses. ” “ Provided I understand your perfidy , sir , and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged , I shall be reasonable enough , ” said Albert furiously .
Had this been all , it might not , perhaps , have greatly signified ; for when the lower classes alone complained , the court of France , separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the _bourgeoisie_ , seldom listened to their voice ; but unluckily , Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests , at a high price ; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places , and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place , the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves , and , enraged , swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their number , but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue ; and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance , to combine to indemnify him for his loss .
“ The Comte de la Fere ! ” he cried in his turn .
He is a cardinal likewise .
“ Is that Monte Cristo ? ” asked the traveller , to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted , in a melancholy voice .
As to D ’ Artagnan , he remained standing like a man in consternation , with the deepest affliction depicted on his face .
One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse .
I shot two with my double-barrelled gun , and two more with my pistols , but I was then disarmed , and two were still left ; one seized me by the hair ( that is why I now wear it so short , for no one knows what may happen ) , the other swung a yataghan , and I already felt the cold steel on my neck , when this gentleman whom you see here charged them , shot the one who held me by the hair , and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre .
he is really dead .
Yet , speaking of reports , baron , what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques ? ” “ The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques ! ” exclaimed Villefort , unable to repress an exclamation .
Do you think they will grant it ? ” “ Without doubt. ” “ How many are they ? ” “ Four , and the two bandits make six. ” “ Just our number , so that if they prove troublesome , we shall be able to hold them in check ; so , for the last time , steer to Monte Cristo. ” “ Yes , but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions. ” “ By all means , be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses ; I do more than permit , I exhort you. ” “ Silence , then ! ” said Gaetano .
The air he inhaled was no longer pure , but thick and mephitic , —he was in prison .
The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans ; the door was opened , and the young men , eagerly alighting , found themselves opposite a _cicerone_ , who appeared to have sprung up from the ground , so unexpected was his appearance .
“ Yes , your French husband .
Chapter 18 .
Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow .
“ I am saved ! ” murmured he .
“ My own service ! ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Look at this lady , Raoul , she is an historic personage ; it was to visit her King Henry IV .
I have but one portmanteau. ” “ I dare say you have nothing else with you .
“ My dear fellow , don ’ t speak like that of Monsieur Groslow .
“ ’ Tis indeed they ! ” said she .
But , then your word is given. ” “ Yes , doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her , but not to one who does not .
“ At least , I am now at liberty to believe , without too much fatuity , that you love another , ” said the young man , in a caressing tone , “ and I repeat that I am really interested for the count. ” “ You ? ” asked Milady .
The devil ! ” murmured D ’ Artagnan ; “ all this is vague enough .
I wish to see everything. ” “ If your majesty wishes to look out—well , then , look ! ” replied D ’ Artagnan .
“ Well , ” cried his auditors ; “ at the moment you left his house ? ” Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat .
“ Well , sir , ” replied Eugénie , “ I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come , I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible. ” “ But , ” said Danglars , whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic , marking evident premeditation and force of will , “ what is your reason for this refusal , Eugénie ?
Again , the moderate fortune which Athos possessed , concealed as it was , so skillfully , seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused .
Patrick soon caught the sound of his master ’ s voice calling his falcon .
It contained half a line , in a hand perfectly British , and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan : _Thank you ; be easy_ .
Chapter I .
The servants , standing in the doorway , not daring to approach nearer , were looking at Noirtier ’ s old servant , who had heard the noise from his master ’ s room , and run there also , remaining behind the others .
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery , and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal .
In the meanwhile the hours passed , if not rapidly , at least tolerably .
“ Monseigneur , your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me ; and on the contrary , I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness .
“ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence ; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance , and I have profited by that chance , like a good and devoted servant—that ’ s all .
He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter , signed “ Baronne Danglars , _née_ Hermine de Servieux. ” Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray , who , joining in his friend ’ s conversation , added some passing compliments , the source of which the count ’ s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess .
You are still with us , I presume ? ” “ More than ever .
The old man obeyed .
The host stood at the door .
THE MAN OF MEUNG Chapter XV .
See him there , cold as marble and proud like his father .
She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty , surmounted by a beacon just lighted , and a rock which jutted out .
“ Is that what you wish for ? ” asked she .
“ Well , beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army. ” “ Oh , M. de Morcerf , ” interrupted Morrel .
Who can answer for that ?
What is such or such a prince to us , who fixed the diadem upon a great queen ’ s head ?

“ It is well for Albert he is not in the army , ” said Morrel .
The Gascon shook his head , these tears from royalty melted his heart .
The count then placed his foot on his head , saying , “ I know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull , rascal. ” “ Ah , mercy—mercy ! ” cried Caderousse .
Mademoiselle d ’ Armilly , whom they then perceived through the open doorway , formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so fond .
Stay , here is another louis for you. ” “ Then that will make only 4,998 louis more , ” said Peppino with the same indifference .
Albert understood the allusion in a moment , and was about to throw his glove at the count , when Morrel seized his hand , while Beauchamp and Château-Renaud , fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge , held him back .
“ Oh , I confess it is all the same to me. ” “ Oh , you need not avow this religious indifference , my Lord ; your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it. ” “ What , you talk of debaucheries , Madame Messalina , Lady Macbeth !
One instant after , the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor—his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder .
When the patron awoke , the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set , and every sail full with the breeze .
As to the rest of the blade , the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin .
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal , who did not shudder readily .
0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication , and turning towards Fernand , said , “ Well , you understand there is no need to kill him. ” “ Certainly not , if , as you said just now , you have the means of having Dantès arrested .
Maximilian Morrel , ” said the servant , announcing two fresh guests .
Brought up in Paris , where Raoul had been but once ; at the court , which Raoul had never seen ; his follies as page ; two duels , which he had already found the means of fighting , in spite of the edicts against them and , more especially , in spite of his tutor ’ s vigilance—these things excited the greatest curiosity in Raoul .
Chapter XXV .

I will not have you left alone so long .
You see I am calm and strong .
Four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners .
“ Cæs ... ar † Spada. ” “ Well , do you comprehend now ? ” inquired Faria .
“ Oh , ” said Dantès timidly , “ what is the matter ? ” Villefort made no answer , but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds , and again perused the letter .
de Chevreuse and consequently the queen .
“ Milady. ” “ Oh , yes ! ” said Porthos ; “ true , I had forgotten it ! ” Athos looked at him intently .
“ ‘ To Troyes , in Champagne , ’ I answered .
“ Ha , ha , ” said Château-Renaud , “ here come some friends of yours , viscount !
“ In the name of Heaven , ” said Maximilian , “ if you know anything of him , tell us what it is. ” “ Alas , ” cried Monte Cristo , striving to repress his emotion , “ if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor , I fear you will never see him again .
At nine o ’ clock the president of the club presented himself ; the general was ready , the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting , and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged , swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage .
Andrea had , then , in a fortnight , attained a very fair position .
The moment you become an inhabitant of France , you are naturally subjected to the French law. ” “ I know it sir , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but when I visit a country I begin to study , by all the means which are available , the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear , till I know them as well as , perhaps better than , they know themselves .
The Pope , therefore blesses with the fingers .
“ And that you alone , amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers—for you have said so , ” observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat— “ you alone are perfect. ” “ No , not perfect , ” was the count ’ s reply ; “ only impenetrable , that ’ s all .
The Return .
I rely on your friendship to assist me , Beauchamp , if contempt has not banished it from your heart. ” “ Contempt , my friend ?
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me , but I resisted .
Château-Renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_ , joined him ; Beauchamp did the same .
“ Oh , oh , ” said the brigadier , who thoroughly understood the trick ; “ a bad sign to find the door open !
Mother and Son Chapter 92 .
“ No , madame ; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends. ” And Porthos , turning on his heel , made a step to retire .
Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first .
He drew up for a minute , threw a rapid glance around him , and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket , where it began playing with a pistol .
“ ‘ That will teach me , ’ he said , ‘ to have my guards provided with better horses ; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend , you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive. ’ ” “ Well , there ’ s nothing bad in that , it seems to me , ” said Porthos .
“ It is he whom we must warn .
The guards , more skillful , did greater execution ; but the bourgeois , more numerous , overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron .
Come , it is worth thinking about ? ” “ For fifteen thousand francs ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Sir , you alarm me. ” “ Nonsense. ” “ Sir , you are tempting me ? ” “ Just so ; fifteen thousand francs , do you understand ? ” “ Sir , let me see my right-hand correspondent. ” “ On the contrary , do not look at him , but at this. ” “ What is it ? ” “ What ?
he was alone again !
As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed , I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it .
I want to find out who was the man in the mask , who so obligingly offered to cut the king ’ s throat. ” “ A man in a mask ? ” cried Athos .
It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much ; you gave him three sword-wounds in three separate engagements. ” “ But you know he is now our friend ? ” “ No , I didn ’ t know that .
What has he done ?

“ The paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations .
Sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest _gendarme_ of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the engineers , brought from all the corners of France , were executing under his orders , if he met a Musketeer of the company of Tréville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction .
Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling , a table and two benches composed the entire furniture .
This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours , then ? ” “ By no means .
He therefore dined very silently , in spite of the officious attention of his host , who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything .
I positively refuse ; intrigues terrify me .
“ Carlini flew joyfully to Rita , telling her she was saved , and bidding her write to her father , to inform him what had occurred , and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres .
“ Monsieur Bertuccio , you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil. ” Bertuccio slightly started .
I arose trembling .
“ What do you mean ? ” asked Valentine .
“ Ah !
I will say two words about it to the cardinal ’ s esquire likewise .
why , yourself , to be sure !
“ My intention was , if Caderousse was alone , to acquaint him with my presence , finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted , and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône , and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew .
Unfortunately he was an honorable man ; he married her .
“ Ah , ah , ” murmured he , “ is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society , that his protector thus employs the collective form ?
It was completely deserted .
where are you ?
It is quite regular and explicit , ” said the governor .
Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town , Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched .
He folded the letter fancifully , and took up his pen and wrote : “ _To Mlle .
Ah , but what is the matter with your hand , D ’ Artagnan ?
Then he destroyed the second portion , assured that if the first were seized , no one would be able to discover its real meaning .
by Heaven !
“ Listen ; I am the only man in the world having the right to say to you , ‘ Morrel , your father ’ s son shall not die today ; ’ ” and Monte Cristo , with an expression of majesty and sublimity , advanced with arms folded toward the young man , who , involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man , recoiled a step .
“ Stay here , if you like , but I warn you ’ twill be rather too warm presently. ” “ But we can not swim to the shore. ” “ The longboat is yonder , lashed to the felucca .
With folded arms , he gazed for some time upon the great city .
“ Tut , tut ! ” answered the abbé , “ man is but man after all , and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known .
“ Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors. ” Milady held out her hand to him .
“ A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities .
0148m “ Eh , _pardieu ! _ ” said the individual whose description we have twice given , entering the door , “ what a great deal of ceremony !
That would not be endurable in any case , and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar. ” “ Sir ! ” cried De Chatillon .
We had thus , at Aigues-Mortes , Martigues , or Bouc , a dozen places where we left our goods , and where , in case of necessity , we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom-house officers .
“ I will go—I will go ! ” D ’ Artagnan took the soldier ’ s arquebus , made him go on before him , and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword .
“ No , by your Eminence. ” “ By me ?
Now , as a quarter-past one has already struck , I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying , that , in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès. ” 0069m Fernand closed his eyes , a burning sensation passed across his brow , and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair ; but in spite of all his efforts , he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan , which , however , was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company .
The air they breathed was heavy , damp , and cold .
At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder .
All his emotion then burst forth ; he cast himself on the ground , weeping bitterly , and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished .
One by one the several groups broke up .
But by what means ?
It is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man , Valentine did not suffer by the contrast .
“ Ah , _pardieu ! _ ” said Beauchamp , “ with the paper in your hand , my friend , I need not tell you the cause of my visit. ” “ Are you interested in the sugar question ? ” asked the editor of the ministerial paper .
“ Gramercy !
D ’ Artagnan had , with his sword , cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed .
The president rose , appointed three members to accompany him , and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes .
Chapter XXI .
“ Athos , ” replied the Musketeer .
The conversation took a cheerful turn .
if we had been five ! ” murmured Athos , thinking of D ’ Artagnan and Porthos .
There always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God ; and see , perhaps it is a happiness for you , humble and powerless as I am , that you have met with me , for if I leave this place , well—I have powerful friends , who , after having exerted themselves on my account , may also exert themselves for you. ” “ Oh , when I said I was alone , ” said Milady , hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself , “ it is not for want of friends in high places ; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal .
“ My friends , that ’ s exactly like me !
I am just setting out for Blois .
Explain to me why going out of this chamber isn ’ t everything. ” “ Because , having neither arms nor password , we shouldn ’ t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel. ” “ Very well , ” said Porthos , “ we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms. ” “ Yes , but before we can kill him—and he will be hard to kill , that Swiss—he will shriek out and the whole picket will come , and we shall be taken like foxes , we , who are lions , and thrown into some dungeon , where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of Rueil , which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the moon is like the sun .
Perhaps what I am about to say may seem strange to you , who are socialists , and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor , but I never seek to protect a society which does not protect me , and which I will even say , generally occupies itself about me only to injure me ; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem , and preserving a neutrality towards them , it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me. ” “ Bravo , ” cried Château-Renaud ; “ you are the first man I ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism .
He converted his chamber into an observatory .
But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him ; and then , when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d ’ If , and heard the distant report , he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going , like that of kings , was accompanied with salutes of artillery .
Precautions .
“ Well , this waistcoat was discovered today , covered with blood , and with a hole over the heart. ” The ladies screamed , and two or three prepared to faint .

A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world , even to a man void of uneasiness ; but for one who has a timid conscience , and with good cause too , the yellow , blue , and white uniform is really very alarming .
“ And Dauphiné , sir ? ” inquired the king , of Villefort .
This time D ’ Artagnan was only in part mistaken ; he himself was not in question , but his horse was .
Do not you recollect , I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency , as I come today to plead for justice .
It is not natural for letters to enter people ’ s houses in this manner .
D ’ Artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder .
I have a hundred pounds ’ weight less upon my chest .
The man , hearing nothing more , stood erect , and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire , whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale .
Cries of “ Down with Mazarin ! ” “ Death to the cardinal ! ” resounded on all sides .
Athos perceived this embarrassment , and by way of supplying an effectual remedy , called for four bottles of champagne .
“ Then , father , ” said Raoul , forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart , “ if you are a priest you have an opportunity , as my friend has told you , of exercising your vocation .
“ It is a false diamond , ” said Caderousse .
yes ; but why don ’ t you come there also ? ” Athos colored a little and answered : “ Should I go , I shall be delighted to see you there. ” “ Halloo , Planchet ! ” cried the Gascon from the door , “ we must set out in ten minutes ; give the horses some hay. ” Then turning to Athos he added : “ I seem to miss something here .
“ I would not lose this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me , which I am determined to conquer , whatever they may be , by my devotion. ” And without listening to Villefort he arose , and followed Valentine , who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to .
“ Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds ; if Monsieur de Tréville heard you , you would repent of speaking thus. ” “ Are you going to give me a lesson , Porthos ? ” cried Aramis , from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning .
Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count ; for I imagine , just now , that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us .
“ You are welcome , monsieur , ” said Milady , in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which D ’ Artagnan had just remarked ; “ you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude. ” The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail .
“ Ah , now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis , in which I am not initiated .
“ I will be silent , then , ” said Milady , casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice , with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner .
Her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea ; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly : “ Edmond , Edmond , Edmond ! ” Chapter 113 .
But remember , also , that if by your fault any evil happens to D ’ Artagnan , I will find you , wherever you may be , for the purpose of ripping up your belly. ” “ Oh , monsieur ! ” said Planchet , humiliated by the suspicion , and moreover , terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer .
I understand perfectly. ” Again Danglars bit his lips ; he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort , and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial .
At about a league and a half from the city , D ’ Artagnan , finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon , stopped to give the horses breathing time .
what mean you by that ? ” “ They have eyes , ” cried Milady , “ but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not. ” “ Yes , yes ! ” said Felton , passing his hands over his brow , covered with sweat , as if to remove his last doubt .
Milady was habitually pale ; her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time .
What a proposition ! ” “ I thought , perhaps , ” said Danglars with supreme impertinence , “ that you had a deficiency to make up ? ” “ Indeed , ” said the receiver .
ah !
_My Mass ? _ Lord de Winter , the corrupted Catholic , knows very well that I am not of his religion , and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me ! ” “ And of what religion are you , then , madame ? ” asked Felton , with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal .
Then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy , “ Besides , ” continued he , “ I have reflected , my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy , that I am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be ; so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine. ” “ No , upon my honor ! ” cried his Majesty ’ s Guardsman .
The young men , therefore , had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_ , supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of Italy .

And they walked on again .

When the grave was formed , the father embraced her first , and then the lover ; afterwards , one taking the head , the other the feet , they placed her in the grave .
Do you see it ? ” and the man held the torch to the wall .
Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically , and just touched the glass with her lips .
D ’ Artagnan looked at the two women , one after the other , and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in their formation .

He remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine , and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul .

“ ‘ The president again arose , and having imposed silence , said , — “ Sir , you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation , and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you. ” The general , putting his hand on his sword , exclaimed , — “ If you talk of honor , do not begin by disavowing its laws , and impose nothing by violence. ” “ ‘ “ And you , sir , ” continued the president , with a calmness still more terrible than the general ’ s anger , “ I advise you not to touch your sword. ” The general looked around him with slight uneasiness ; however he did not yield , but calling up all his fortitude , said , — “ I will not swear. ” “ ‘ “ Then you must die , ” replied the president calmly .
His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body .
He went then to the queen , and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her .
I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you , who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions and sensations .
“ That ’ s right , ” said Athos ; “ put your other hand here. ” And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support , so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt ; and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers .
never fear , ” said Aramis .
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful , and so full of affectionate admiration , that she turned back and grasped his hand ; at the same time she seized that of her son , and joined them together .
At one corner , where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day , a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house , which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it , though situated but a hundred paces off .
“ Yes , yes ! ” murmured D ’ Artagnan ; “ that ’ s the place—Milady ’ s own residence ! ” Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him , as well as all who loved him , and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court , since she had discovered all .
Ah , those Orientals ; they are the only men who know how to live .
The house Ali had chosen , and which was to serve as a town residence to Monte Cristo , was situated on the right hand as you ascend the Champs-Élysées .
You are stupid , ” replied the cardinal .
“ Which are your windows ? ” asked he of the count , with as much indifference as he could assume .
I am too well aware that though a subordinate , like myself , is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs , there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else. ” “ ’ Tis well , Danglars— ’ tis well ! ” replied M. Morrel .
I have seen Milady. ” “ Where ? ” demanded D ’ Artagnan .
“ That gentleman is the Abbé d ’ Herblay , ” replied he .
At last they reached the tennis court .
While yet young , unfortunately handsome , I was dragged into a snare .
“ Whom does this belong to ? ” he inquired .
Why , in passing through Lilliers you will send me your chaise , with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal. ” “ Well. ” “ You have , no doubt , some order from the cardinal about you ? ” “ I have my _full power_. ” “ Show it to the abbess , and tell her that someone will come and fetch me , either today or tomorrow , and that I am to follow the person who presents himself in your name. ” “ Very well. ” “ Don ’ t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess. ” “ To what purpose ? ” “ I am a victim of the cardinal .
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill. As for you , although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves , I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field. ” Valentine colored .
Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt ; all was over—she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish .
“ She is quite well , ” replied Danglars quickly ; “ she is at the piano with M. Cavalcanti. ” Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner ; he might feel perhaps annoyed , but he knew Monte Cristo ’ s eye was on him .

It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man , it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family ; it is not only a right , but a duty. ” “ You wrote , sir , knowing what answer you would receive. ” “ I , indeed ?
Tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator , and muscular as a Spartan , he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps , actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken .
When the gentleman who came three months ago—the agent of Thomson & French—arrives , announce his arrival to me. ” Cocles made no reply ; he made a sign with his head , went into the anteroom , and seated himself .
But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns , which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act .
His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance .
Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word .
“ _Morbleu_ , monsieur ! ” said he , “ however far I may come , it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners , I warn you. ” “ Perhaps , ” said Athos .
We need hardly add that these peasant costumes , like those of the young women , were brilliant with gold and jewels .
“ Are we going to continue this pace all night ? ” asked Planchet .
Kitty entered to bring some sherbet .
At six o ’ clock Lord de Winter came in .
my lord ! ” cried the Gascon , “ don ’ t threaten !
“ It seems a likely story to me. ” “ And to me , too. ” “ Besides , we can but blow out his brains if he proves false , ” said the Gascon ; “ and you , Athos , you know something of everything and can be our captain .
When they were gone , Morrel ventured out from under the trees , and the moon shone upon his face , which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost .
Who ’ s up there ? ” said the man .
“ So that he told me , that poor Monsieur Maillard , ‘ Go find the coadjutor , Friquet , and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir. ’ Say , then , Father Bazin—the heir of Monsieur Maillard , the giver of holy water at Saint Eustache !
Aramis , you think that D ’ Artagnan , that Porthos , would lend their hands to such an infamy ? ” “ Among friends , my dear Athos , no , you are right ; but among enemies it would be only a stratagem. ” Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head .
As soon as you feel able to swim we will go. ” “ I shall never swim again , ” replied Faria .
This promise completed poor Kitty ’ s consolation .
Albert was punctual .
Mordaunt went away with the captain .
I dragged myself as far as the yard .
She was sent by her mistress to the false De Wardes .
By degrees the passage narrowed , yet the duke continued his course .

The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal ; and four-and-twenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution .
“ Alas , ” said Edmond , smiling , “ these are the treasures the cardinal has left ; and the good abbé , seeing in a dream these glittering walls , has indulged in fallacious hopes. ” But he called to mind the words of the will , which he knew by heart .
As for my wife , I must tell you , she lowered herself by marrying me , for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France .
He is not dead , then ? ” “ No , monsieur , he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body ; for you , without question , inflicted four upon the dear gentleman , and he is still very weak , having lost almost all his blood .
CAPTIVITY : THE FIRST DAY Let us return to Milady , whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France has made us lose sight of for an instant .
At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust .
“ I am incredulous. ” The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there , and presented it to the cardinal .
“ Yes , just so .
He could not yet see that dreadful cross , but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him .
The two friends repaired to Athos ’ s , and he , faithful to his vow of not going out , took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them .
I am of your opinion , but find me a better one or give me the means of living. ” Athos was for a few moments thoughtful .
“ Approach him , ” said she , “ and when the next waiter passes , insist upon his taking something. ” “ But why , mother ? ” “ Just to please me , Albert , ” said Mercédès .
I prize it—it was given to my ancestor by King Francis I .
“ You ! ” he said , “ you !
Do you talk of a sacrifice ? ” “ I do. ” “ Do you then suspect anyone ? ” “ I suspect no one ; death raps at your door—it enters—it goes , not blindfolded , but circumspectly , from room to room .
I ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you. ” Porthos , without reply , retreated a second step .
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day. ” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain , Caderousse hastily exclaimed : “ A thousand pardons !

“ If you do not go , sir , ” said De Guiche , “ remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be ; and then I swear your trial will be summary ; one can always find a tree and a cord. ” The monk ’ s eye again flashed , but that was all ; he merely repeated his phrase , “ I will go , ” —and he went .
“ Oh , fear nothing , madame ! ” said the young woman , clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen ’ s sorrows ; “ I am your Majesty ’ s , body and soul , and however far I may be from you , however inferior may be my position , I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your Majesty from your trouble. ” “ You , oh , heaven , you ! ” cried the queen ; “ but look me in the face .

The sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : “ Who are you , gentlemen ? ” “ Two gentlemen. ” “ And where do you come from ? ” “ From London. ” “ And what are you going to do in Paris ? ” “ We are going with a mission to Her Majesty , the Queen of England. ” “ Ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of England .

Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself ; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais Royal , the cardinal knocked at a little door , and after thanking D ’ Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal , he made a sign to Guitant to follow him .

“ Yes , ” continued the duke , “ really , I feel bored today beyond the power of description. ” “ Then let us have a match in the tennis court , ” exclaimed La Ramee .

Now , as I have never known any Sinbad , with the exception of the one celebrated in the _Thousand and One Nights_—— ” “ Well , it is one of his descendants , and a great friend of mine ; he is a very rich Englishman , eccentric almost to insanity , and his real name is Lord Wilmore. ” “ Ah , indeed ?
Take care of yourself , and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of .

He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope ; then he began to doubt his own innocence , which justified in some measure the governor ’ s belief in his mental alienation ; and then , relaxing his sentiment of pride , he addressed his supplications , not to God , but to man .
The baron took the young officer by the arm , and turned his head over his shoulder , so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out .

To-day it ’ s a sort of diplomatic arrangement ; ask Planchet. ” Mousqueton inquired , therefore , the state of the case of his old friend , who confirmed the statement of D ’ Artagnan .
D ’ Artagnan smiled .
Ah , s ’ blood , how you have hurt me !
“ When you had betrayed your friend , God began not to strike , but to warn you .
The man was wrapped up in a large cloak .

Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head , and looked carefully around the chamber .
I believed you dead ; why did I survive you ?
Oho !
Still he had not even uttered a sigh .
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent , and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape .
Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him , and which , at the end of half an hour , was transformed into a workshop .
“ Have you not thought so ? ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ for that reason I wished to keep you near me. ” “ It is miraculous ! ” continued Morrel , answering his own thoughts .
Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand , and then rising , said , “ Within six months , if I am not dead , I shall have seen you again , madame—even if I have to overturn the world. ” And faithful to the promise he had made , he rushed out of the apartment .
This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements , for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach .
A week passed by .

“ No ; but Gaetano did , I thought. ” “ Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance , he had not then spoken to anyone. ” “ And if this person be not a smuggler , who is he ? ” “ A wealthy signor , who travels for his pleasure. ” “ Come , ” thought Franz , “ he is still more mysterious , since the two accounts do not agree. ” “ What is his name ? ” “ If you ask him , he says Sinbad the Sailor ; but I doubt if it be his real name. ” “ Sinbad the Sailor ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And where does he reside ? ” “ On the sea. ” “ What country does he come from ? ” “ I do not know. ” “ Have you ever seen him ? ” “ Sometimes. ” “ What sort of a man is he ? ” “ Your excellency will judge for yourself. ” “ Where will he receive me ? ” “ No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of. ” “ Have you never had the curiosity , when you have landed and found this island deserted , to seek for this enchanted palace ? ” “ Oh , yes , more than once , but always in vain ; we examined the grotto all over , but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening ; they say that the door is not opened by a key , but a magic word. ” “ Decidedly , ” muttered Franz , “ this is an Arabian Nights ’ adventure. ” “ His excellency waits for you , ” said a voice , which he recognized as that of the sentinel .

“ Ho !
Now for the tally-ho. ” Athos threw himself into D ’ Artagnan ’ s arms .
The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday , at eight o ’ clock in the evening precisely .
“ See , my father , see ! ” Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man , who , almost a stranger to him , called Noirtier his father .
D ’ Artagnan started on seeing these tears .
“ Well , then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the society .
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer , but to have everything he wanted .

This child lives , and someone knows it lives—someone is in possession of our secret ; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred , when that child could not be found , it is he who is in possession of our secret. ” “ Just God , avenging God ! ” murmured Madame Danglars .

“ But , ” Blaisois ventured to say , “ I have heard you relate , Monsieur Mousqueton , that once on a time , at Chantilly , you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare , carp with a line , and bottles with a slipnoose. ” “ Perfectly true ; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles .

He was told that twenty citizens , headed by one man , had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal ’ s bodyguard ; but a reinforcement having come up , the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings ; the house was now being searched .

Truly , this is an indignity ! ” “ Be kind enough to pardon me , madame ; but in this circumstance I am but the instrument which the king employs .
“ Madame , ” replied Planchet , respectfully , “ I am called Dulaurier , at your service. ” “ Thank you , Monsieur Dulaurier , ” said the queen ; “ and what is your business ? ” “ Madame , I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais. ” “ That is all I wished to know , ” said the queen .
It seems his former master accustomed him to that. ” “ Well , dear Monsieur la Ramee , ” replied the cardinal “ let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable , and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king ’ s health. ” Mazarin was large in promises , —quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee ; for he said nothing and did much .

While the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto , Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband ’ s strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at Milan .

Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice ?
“ Without reckoning , ” added Monte Cristo , “ that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England , but quite novel in France. ” “ Yes , yes , I know what you mean , —the railway , of which he has obtained the grant , is it not ? ” “ Precisely ; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair. ” “ Ten millions !

Rumor will probably be busy respecting me , my occupations , my manner of living—that will signify but little , that concerns God , you , and myself. ” “ Mercédès , ” said the count , “ I do not say it to blame you , but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by M. de Morcerf ; half of it at least by right belonged to you , in virtue of your vigilance and economy. ” “ I perceive what you are intending to propose to me ; but I can not accept it , Edmond—my son would not permit it. ” “ Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de Morcerf .
“ In business , sir , ” said he , “ one has no friends , only correspondents. ” “ It is true , ” murmured the Englishman ; “ then you have but one hope. ” “ But one. ” “ The last ? ” “ The last. ” “ So that if this fail—— ” “ I am ruined , —completely ruined ! ” “ As I was on my way here , a vessel was coming into port. ” “ I know it , sir ; a young man , who still adheres to my fallen fortunes , passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house , in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me ; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship. ” “ And it is not yours ? ” “ No , she is a Bordeaux vessel , _La Gironde_ ; she comes from India also ; but she is not mine. ” “ Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_ , and brings you some tidings of her ? ” “ Shall I tell you plainly one thing , sir ?
Moreover , its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English , and by closing it against England , our eternal enemy , the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise .
These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s room .
He put out his hand to remove the object ; it was a fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage ; this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning .

“ And you , sir ? ” he said .
At the Bois de Boulogne , _ennui_ and hunger attacked me at once , —two enemies who rarely accompany each other , and who are yet leagued against me , a sort of Carlo-republican alliance .
Beauchamp , one of the kings of the press , and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere , was eying everybody through his monocle .
ah ! ” said Gondy , reflecting , “ you are right , sir ; some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris ; some one who would know how to cry aloud to them , that all France might hear it , that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty. ” “ Exactly your man. ” “ Bravo !
Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties .
“ Is he then advancing on Paris ? ” The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal .

I have not seen you nor your friends , and I don ’ t think you could gather all that dust that I saw Planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of Paris. ” “ You are right , my dear Monsieur Bonacieux , my friends and I have been on a little journey. ” “ Far from here ? ” “ Oh , Lord , no !
Baptistin re-entered with glasses , wine , and biscuits .
The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation , but rather with alacrity , and , mounting the steps at a bound , entered the hotel ; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room .

“ Without passports , ” said Planchet .
Come , Aramis. ” “ And we , Porthos , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ will return , carrying our shame to the cardinal. ” “ And tell him , ” cried a voice , “ that I am not too old yet for a man of action. ” D ’ Artagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort .
A man , enveloped in a cloak , came out immediately , and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal ; after which he mounted his horse , and set off in the direction of Surgères , which was likewise the way to Paris .
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice , and said , “ I want for this mission three or four volunteers , led by a man who can be depended upon. ” “ As to the man to be depended upon , I have him under my hand , monsieur , ” said M. Dessessart , pointing to D ’ Artagnan ; “ and as to the four or five volunteers , Monsieur has but to make his intentions known , and the men will not be wanting. ” “ Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , raising his sword .

“ Well , then , under these circumstances , ” said Caderousse , “ I will , I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable. ” “ Begin with his father , if you please. ” said the abbé ; “ Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love. ” “ The history is a sad one , sir , ” said Caderousse , shaking his head ; “ perhaps you know all the earlier part of it ? ” “ Yes. ” answered the abbé ; “ Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles. ” “ At La Réserve !
“ Very ! ” “ And all these one hundred and ninety-one were Royalists ? ” asked Athos .
Chapter VII .
Valentine instinctively raised her eyes , as if to thank heaven .

The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials ; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses , after the style and manner of Boucher ; and at each side pretty medallions in crayons , harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment , the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed .
“ Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean , an atom in the infinite. ” “ Precisely ! ” cried Albert .
No doubt , now , we shall hear that our friend is released ! ” Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door .
Albert gathered up his papers hastily , rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord , and offering his arm to his mother , they descended the stairs .

“ I showed you this morning that I had a heart , did I not , count ? ” Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man .
“ Shall I see you again soon ? ” “ Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty , and I will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here , as they must necessarily be much deranged. ” “ Very well ; I shall expect you .

They will be ten times worse off in a week. ” “ Ah , yes !
Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself ? ” “ Yes , miserable wretch ! ” cried Morcerf , “ it is your fault. ” Danglars retreated a few steps .

“ As to myself , I shall go around to see Athos ; for though I don ’ t think his aid worth much , one must with one ’ s friends observe all due politeness , ” said D ’ Artagnan .

Up , sire !
Say I am condemned , sir , if you please ; but you know that God , who loves martyrs , sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned. ” “ Were you condemned , were you innocent , were you a martyr , ” replied Felton , “ the greater would be the necessity for prayer ; and I myself would aid you with my prayers. ” “ Oh , you are a just man ! ” cried Milady , throwing herself at his feet .
