“ Ah , count , ” said Albert , “ I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me , and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you , you must be entirely devoid of them , for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else. ” “ You have talked of me ? ” “ Yes , that is the penalty of being a living puzzle ! ” “ Then I am also a puzzle to your mother ?
“ Very little , except ‘ Long live Cromwell ! ’ ” “ Where were you placed ? ” Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general ’ s face if this was simply a useless question , or whether he knew everything .
I was taken to the slave-market , and was purchased by a rich Armenian .
I have done. ” And D ’ Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis .
At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock .
Planchet and Bazin came last .
“ You also ! ” exclaimed the executioner , “ you use that word which sounds ever in my ears— ‘ assassinated ! ’ I have assassinated , then , and not executed !
“ This gentleman asks me for information , which common politeness will not permit me to refuse. ” “ Politeness , you simpleton ! ” retorted La Carconte .
Milady followed him with her eyes , and made a gesture of satisfaction .
No .
The confidence with which D ’ Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick , which was the name of this minister of the minister .
At that period Buckingham was an ally , and not an enemy .
the devil ! ” “ But , sir , ” said Planchet , with a look of shrewdness , “ I know where Bazin is. ” “ Where is he ? ” “ At Notre Dame. ” “ What has he to do at Notre Dame ? ” “ He is beadle. ” “ Bazin beadle at Notre Dame !
“ Fight , my dear captain , fight .
Porthos was Discontented with his Condition .
And then , besides , the useless blood !
They have , perhaps , some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm .
Another , older and less strong than he , had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake , and had failed only because of an error in calculation .
The happiest thing that could occur to me , would be to die in my father ’ s stead ; that would save us all. ” “ Your mother would die of grief. ” “ My poor mother ! ” said Albert , passing his hand across his eyes , “ I know she would ; but better so than die of shame. ” “ Are you quite decided , Albert ? ” “ Yes ; let us go. ” “ But do you think we shall find the count at home ? ” “ He intended returning some hours after me , and doubtless he is now at home. ” They ordered the driver to take them to No .
Unfortunately , I didn ’ t crush him flat .
He has made up his mind to take a wife from Paris. ” “ A fine idea that of his , ” said Danglars , shrugging his shoulders .
He found Kitty at the gate , and , as on the preceding evening , went up to her chamber .
It was a dark night .
You bring me down to your own level , and demand explanations !
Well , monsieur , I am at your service. ” “ If what you say be true , ” replied the count , smiling , “ perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family ? ” “ Certainly , I will do so , ” said the young man , with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention .
“ Here is Debray , who detests you without reading you , so he says. ” “ He is quite right , ” returned Beauchamp ; “ for I criticise him without knowing what he does .
Now , my lord , he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony. ” “ Only that ? ” said Mazarin , his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthos ’ s devotion without opening his purse ; “ only that ?
Those barrels I saw through the door ? ” “ Port ! ” replied Grimaud , beginning a fresh sum .
In reality , when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises , you are no longer the equal of other men , or , rather , other men are no longer your equals , and whosoever has taken this resolution , feels his strength and resources doubled. ” “ Philosophy , M. Bertuccio , ” interrupted the count ; “ you have done a little of everything in your life. ” “ Oh , excellency ! ” “ No , no ; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late ; yet I have no other observation to make , for what you say is correct , which is more than can be said for all philosophy. ” “ My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive .
You know his success—our dear duke ?
Perceiving M. de Tréville at a distance— “ Come here , Monsieur Captain , ” said he , “ come here , that I may growl at you .
Consult some politician of the period of which you speak , and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want. ” “ Eh , pardieu ! ” said Mazarin , with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money .
The guide carried away the torch .
M. de la Trémouille approached him , and made him inhale some salts , which recalled him to life .

We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy , and follow the baroness , who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her , had gone to seek her usual adviser , Lucien Debray .
I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene .
My God !
Well , you can ask my servant , or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow , it was the talk of the house. ” “ And this elixir , where is it ?
“ What , do you not know your house ? ” asked Debray .
But the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss. ” “ No , for I am only embarked in certainties , ” replied Danglars , with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises ; “ to involve me , three governments must crumble to dust. ” “ Well , such things have been. ” “ That there should be a famine ! ” “ Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine. ” “ Or , that the sea should become dry , as in the days of Pharaoh , and even then my vessels would become caravans. ” “ So much the better .
“ The house is sold , then ? ” demanded the concierge ; “ and this gentleman is coming to live here ? ” “ Yes , my friend , ” returned the count ; “ and I will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master. ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” said the concierge , “ I shall not have much cause to regret him , for he came here but seldom ; it is five years since he was here last , and he did well to sell the house , for it did not bring him in anything at all. ” “ What was the name of your old master ? ” said Monte Cristo .
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed .
Franz , however , did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent .
The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit , and that he desired another under the same conditions .
But why do you ask ? ” “ I will tell you , ” replied the young girl , “ for it is but right you should know .
No ; a more material interest stirred his blood .
“ Did you see the postscript ? ” “ I did , indeed .
“ Ah , sir , ” said Caderousse with a sigh , “ it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man ; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest. ” The abbé fixed on him a searching , penetrating glance .
“ Precisely so , ” replied Gaetano .
“ What !
If I had had a single ornament left , I should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself. ” “ Oh , madame , ” said Mazarin , “ your majesty knows not what you ask .
“ Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer. ” “ But what are your intentions ? ” Mercédès smiled sadly .
The bed had iron clamps , but they were screwed to the wood , and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off .
The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie , which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected .
It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy , they would like him all the better for it ; but that Athos , on the contrary , would despise him .
Is it not a halt in Death ’ s anteroom ? ” 40026m “ I am prejudiced against Beauchamp , ” said Albert , drawing Franz away , and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with Debray .
He again struck it , and with greater force .
Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean , he came , his horse going at a foot ’ s pace , to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge , reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year , seven men surrounded by empty bottles .
Help ! ” Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post ; but at that instant a treble voice , proceeding from a kind of entresol , was heard screeching : “ Murder !
“ Tell your mistress , ” he at length answered , “ that I wish to speak to her , and I beg she will wait for me in her own room. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ Then come to dress and shave me. ” “ Directly , sir. ” The valet re-appeared almost instantly , and , having shaved his master , assisted him to dress entirely in black .
Bowed down with fatigue , she was indeed confined to her bed ; and it was in her own room , and from the lips of Madame de Villefort , that she heard all the strange events we have related ; we mean the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti , or rather Benedetto , together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him .
Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds .

The Englishmen , convinced of these peaceful proceedings , sheathed their swords grumblingly .
She has a fruitful imagination , and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first. ” And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton , and led him out , laughing .
Franz looked up—they were opposite the Rospoli Palace .
0335m “ There , you see , wife , ” said the former , “ this splendid diamond might all be ours , if we chose ! ” “ Do you believe it ? ” “ Why , surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us ! ” “ Well , ” replied La Carconte , “ do as you like .
Maximilian sprang down the staircase , and threw his arms round his father ’ s neck ; but suddenly he recoiled , and placed his right hand on Morrel ’ s breast .

Will you sell him to me for that sum ? ’ ‘ No ; but I will play for him. ’ ‘ What ? ’ ‘ At dice. ’ No sooner said than done , and I lost the horse .
Mordaunt was livid , but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance .
“ When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked God , for I thought I was about to die .
“ Arrived in London , you will seek Buckingham. ” “ I must beg your Eminence to observe , ” said Milady , “ that since the affair of the diamond studs , about which the duke always suspected me , his Grace distrusts me. ” “ Well , this time , ” said the cardinal , “ it is not necessary to steal his confidence , but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator. ” “ Frankly and loyally , ” repeated Milady , with an unspeakable expression of duplicity .
The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies ; but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber , each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground .
“ You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman. ” “ Perhaps so ; and I have an excuse , for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you , I imagine. ” And the baron pointed , with a slow and accusing gesture , to the left shoulder of Milady , which he almost touched with his finger .
Grimaud fell—precipitated into the moat .
“ Undoubtedly I know it , but it is a mystery. ” “ Not to me , I hope ? ” “ No , not to you , so I am going to tell you where he is. ” Porthos devoured D ’ Artagnan with wondering eyes .
But he can easily become one , if he is not already ; it is no uncommon thing in Italy .
She will repent , and no one will know that she has been guilty .
A second after , he saw it again , approaching with frightful rapidity .
There are hours which last a year .
Now , ” he added , rising in the stirrups and looking about him , “ which , I wonder , is the Lightning ? ” At this moment , as if in reply to his words , a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him .
Here is the prisoner ; let us attend to what is most pressing. ” The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy , and grew old in stratagems and spoils .
I hope , madame , that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ! ” “ Ah !
I bear the traces of our friendship—three slits or slashes from your sword. ” “ Well , if you should be restored to favor , don ’ t forget me. ” “ On the honor of a Rochefort ; but you must do the like for me. ” “ There ’ s my hand , —I promise. ” “ Therefore , whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf—— ” “ I shall say it , and you ? ” “ I shall do the same. ” “ Apropos , are we to speak of your friends also , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis ?
Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested , the instant that he left the trenches , to come to the quarters of the Musketeers .
Aramis , after a journey into Lorraine , disappeared all at once , and ceased to write to his friends ; they learned at a later period through Mme .
We have nothing to fear from those who love us. ” “ You speak very suddenly of love , monsieur , ” said the young woman , shaking her head .

Oh , Queen !
A better idea , however , came into her mind before going to bed .
“ Pardon me , I love him so much ! ” These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace .
But Andrea drew a cigar-case from his pocket , took a Havana , quietly lit it , and began smoking .
We depart from one place , and arrive at another , that is all .
“ Now , then , to breakfast , ” said Beauchamp ; “ for , if I remember , you told me you only expected two persons , Albert. ” “ Morrel , ” muttered Albert— “ Morrel—who is he ? ” But before he had finished , M. de Château-Renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , —that is , with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemart , —took Albert ’ s hand .
I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving , for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of love .
He will give you a horse all saddled , and will point out to you the road you ought to take .
Whether he kept a watch over himself , or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched , he was tonight like everybody else .
“ You , Aramis , know Anne of Austria better than I do .
No one knows what there is. ” “ And where is it ? ” “ On the first floor. ” “ Sketch me the plan of that floor , as you have done of the ground floor , my boy. ” “ That is very simple. ” Andrea took the pen .
It is true that since I left him , I seem to have lost my senses .
In the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes—gigantic cabbages walk gravely about , buffaloes ’ heads bellow from men ’ s shoulders , dogs walk on their hind legs ; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted , and , as in Callot ’ s Temptation of St. Anthony , a lovely face is exhibited , which we would fain follow , but from which we are separated by troops of fiends .
The fair Indian , astonished at the sensation her observation produced , looked down and resumed her air of naivete .
“ Now , ” he continued , “ withdraw a little and let me say my prayer , I beseech you .
“ Oh , I will be a match for you ! ” murmured Milady , between her teeth ; “ be assured of that , you poor spoiled monk , you poor converted soldier , who has cut his uniform out of a monk ’ s frock ! ” “ By the way , ” resumed de Winter , stopping at the threshold of the door , “ you must not , Milady , let this check take away your appetite .
“ Pardon me , monseigneur , for saying such things , but they form my excuse .
Olivain managed in his turn to land , after crossing himself repeatedly ; and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank , with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat .
“ I must go thither tonight ? ” “ Instantly !
“ I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man ; but leave us , I pray you. ” The baron went out sobbing .
“ Yonder is the house , Porthos , ” said the Gascon ; “ let me do what I please and do you what I do. ” They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut , four fine horses .
So call me Mercédès , if you please. ” “ We must excuse our worthy neighbor , Caderousse , ” said Dantès , “ he is so easily mistaken. ” “ So , then , the wedding is to take place immediately , M. Dantès , ” said Danglars , bowing to the young couple .
“ Kill a woman ?
Every pulse beat with feverish excitement , every nerve was strained , every vein swollen , and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest , thus multiplying his agony a thousand-fold .
“ His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together. ” “ Ah , my dear father ! ” exclaimed Andrea , evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure .
They both dismounted , consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door , and disappeared in the garden .
They arrived at Amiens at midnight , and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden Lily .
“ But that is not a man ’ s name ; that is the name of a mountain , ” cried the poor questioner , who began to lose his head .
Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes ? ” “ I do not think so , my lord , ” said Bernouin ; “ but you will hear about him , for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence. ” “ Tell him to come in , ” said Mazarin , arranging his pillows , so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed .
The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre , which they entered .

“ Are they Spanish , Haitian , or Neapolitan bonds ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Did you hear ? ” said Madame Danglars .
The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated .
“ Back already !
I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite ; they know me by heart , and are steeled against all my weapons .
“ However , be that as it may , the young man made a tunnel , how or by what means no one knows ; but he made it , and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work .
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse .
“ A child ! ” he exclaimed .
50181m The president called for the indictment , revised as we know , by the clever and implacable pen of Villefort .
“ I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed , ” said Cromwell , staring very fixedly at Mordaunt .
“ One plan occurred to me , ” continued Albert ; “ Franz likes all that is eccentric ; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most alluring style , he invariably answered : ‘ My eccentricity may be great , but it will not make me break my promise. ’ ” “ That is what I call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself. ” Albert smiled .
Unable to have me for your wife , you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister ; and besides , ” she added , her eyes troubled and moistened with tears , “ wait , wait , Fernand ; you said just now that the sea was treacherous , and he has been gone four months , and during these four months there have been some terrible storms. ” Fernand made no reply , nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of Mercédès , although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart ’ s blood ; but these tears flowed for another .
All England is tired of your iniquities ; my Lord , you have abused the royal power , which you have almost usurped ; my Lord , you are held in horror by God and men .
He hesitated a moment , he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil ’ s punishment .
VOLUME THREE 30009m 30011m Chapter 48 .
“ Gracious me ! ” said Porthos , “ there ’ s Phoebus ruined. ” “ The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles. ” “ I ’ m above that. ” “ Let us set out again , at full gallop. ” “ Yes , if we can. ” But at last the lieutenant ’ s horse refused to go on ; he could not breathe ; one last spur , instead of making him advance , made him fall .
D ’ Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham , whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved , the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen .
Athos extended his arm toward him , pointing him out to his companions .
Notwithstanding all the pains he took , D ’ Artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new-made friends .
“ ‘ Your very devoted husband , “ ‘ Baron Danglars. ’ ” The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter , and saw him , notwithstanding his self-control , change color once or twice .
We have secured him. ” “ Yes , ” said Aramis , “ through an infamous act of treason. ” Porthos pressed his friend ’ s hand and said to him : “ Yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! ” At this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected Charles ’ s retreat , was advancing to meet the English regiments .
No , I want to live ; I shall struggle to the very last ; I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been deprived .
I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the ground to fill up the hole ; while doing so I had leaned against a laburnum ; behind me was an artificial rockery , intended to serve as a resting-place for persons walking in the garden ; in falling , my hand , relaxing its hold of the laburnum , felt the coldness of the stone .
“ Well , ” said the queen , when the chancellor had finished speaking ; “ what do you think of it all ? ” “ I think that matters look very gloomy , madame. ” “ But what step would you propose to me ? ” “ I could propose one to your majesty , but I dare not. ” “ You may , you may , sir , ” said the queen with a bitter smile ; “ you were not so timid once. ” The chancellor reddened and stammered some words .
Mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran ; and M. de Saint-Méran is dead .
At length he went to bed , fell asleep , and had golden dreams .
you have seen your dream realized. ” “ I can still say it is a dream ; a retired baker , my poor Benedetto , is rich—he has an annuity. ” “ Well , you have an annuity. ” “ I have ? ” 40134m “ Yes , since I bring you your two hundred francs. ” Caderousse shrugged his shoulders .
“ You ? ” “ Yes. ” “ You have them ? ” “ I have them. ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said the major , who , seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers , feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000 francs— “ ah , indeed , that is a fortunate circumstance ; yes , that really is lucky , for it never occurred to me to bring them. ” “ I do not at all wonder at it—one can not think of everything ; but , happily , the Abbé Busoni thought for you. ” “ He is an excellent person. ” “ He is extremely prudent and thoughtful. ” “ He is an admirable man , ” said the major ; “ and he sent them to you ? ” “ Here they are. ” The major clasped his hands in token of admiration .
This person walked along the terrace , which was ornamented with flowers .
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper , which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident , monotonous note .
I dare say you know how to navigate , should he fail us. ” “ My dear friend , you guess well .
Milady breathed again .
Athos was introduced and announced by name .
D ’ Avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead , and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier .
“ From day to day he lived on alone , and more and more solitary .
But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband , who has but the commencement of the art—for generally husbands _will_ not see—you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world .
“ It was too warm in the room , was it not , count ? ” she asked .
You will tell him , in order that he may not doubt , that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul , which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn , and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles. ” “ Well , monseigneur ? ” “ All the details of his coming into and going out of the palace—on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune teller—you will tell him , that he may not doubt the correctness of my information ; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears , death ’ s heads , and crossbones—for in case of a surprise , he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who , as all the world knows , appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending. ” “ Is that all , monseigneur ? ” “ Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at Amiens ; that I will have a little romance made of it , wittily turned , with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance. ” “ I will tell him that. ” “ Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power ; that Montague is in the Bastille ; that no letters were found upon him , it is true , but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows , and even what he does not know. ” “ Exactly. ” “ Then add that his Grace has , in the precipitation with which he quit the Isle of Ré , forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen , inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France .
The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber .
“ My God , ” said Valentine , raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression , “ I have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter ; I have begged , entreated , implored ; he has regarded neither my prayers , my entreaties , nor my tears .
The Treasure Chapter 19 .
The troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings .
Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret ?
They found the door ajar .
Come , come , dearest Valentine , confess that what I say is true , lest I be tempted to call you unjust. ” 30055m “ It is true , ” said Valentine , as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks , and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them , “ and you are a true and faithful friend ; but still you acted from motives of self-interest , my dear Maximilian , for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us .
‘ If he should really be guilty , ’ said he , ‘ and did really put in to the Island of Elba ; if he is really charged with a letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris , and if they find this letter upon him , those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices. ’ I confess I had my fears , in the state in which politics then were , and I held my tongue .
“ On the ground floor , dining-room , two drawing-rooms , billiard-room , staircase in the hall , and a little back staircase. ” “ Windows ? ” “ Magnificent windows , so beautiful , so large , that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame. ” “ Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows ? ” “ Luxury has everything. ” “ But shutters ? ” “ Yes , but they are never used .
But as Villefort saw his father but seldom , and then only when absolutely obliged , and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there , all the old man ’ s happiness was centred in his granddaughter .
Do you take any interest in politics ? ” A gleam of light shone in Aramis ’ s eyes , as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face , but not so brief but that it was seen by D ’ Artagnan .
Two large slabs of marble , on which were inscribed their names , were placed on either side of a little enclosure , railed in , and shaded by four cypress-trees .
In fact , he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream , or at least the delirium of a fever .
The assizes , also , were about to begin , and Villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse .
A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal .
The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor .
D ’ Artagnan then looked around attentively .
“ No , the sacrifice , ” returned Château-Renaud ; “ ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger ? ” “ Not for a stranger , ” said Debray , “ but for a friend I might , perhaps. ” “ I divined that you would become mine , count , ” replied Morrel ; “ besides , as I had the honor to tell you , heroism or not , sacrifice or not , that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us. ” “ The history to which M. Morrel alludes , ” continued Château-Renaud , “ is an admirable one , which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him ; today let us fill our stomachs , and not our memories .
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon , and carefully arranged ; such , for instance , as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes , that of the Abbé Dubuquoi from For l ’ Evêque ; of Latude from the Bastille .
You might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark. ” “ I agree with you , monsieur , ” said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion , “ such consequences would be extremely unpleasant. ” “ Nevertheless , you must not exaggerate the evil , ” said Monte Cristo , “ for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another .
Holloa , Patrick ! ” “ Sign , my Lord ! ” “ Never. ” “ Never ? ” “ Help ! ” shouted the duke ; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword .
“ Bad , monsieur , bad ! ” replied the king ; “ I am bored. ” This was , in fact , the worst complaint of Louis XIII. , who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say , “ Monsieur So-and-so , let us weary ourselves together. ” “ How !
The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be ; those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold , and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony .
hush ! ” murmured the dying man , “ that they may not separate us if you save me ! ” “ You are right .
The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other .
Let us go and have a game at tennis , La Ramee. ” “ My lord—I beg your highness ’ s pardon—but I must beg for half an hour ’ s leave of absence. ” “ Why ? ” “ Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness , though not of such high birth : he forgot to ask me to breakfast. ” “ Well , shall I send for some breakfast here ? ” “ No , my lord ; I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle—Daddy Marteau , as they called him—— ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris , an invalid , ordered country air for his health. ” “ Well , what have I to do with that ? ” “ Why , good Lord !
When this was done , Eugénie opened a drawer , of which she kept the key , and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak .
Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt , and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count , —a warning he might not be able to send another time , if this first attempt should fail and another be made. ’ ” The count ’ s first idea was that this was an artifice—a gross deception , to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater .
Now to the work I have in hand. ” And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone , the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed .
You are free to-night , without fighting ; so much the better !
Having been several times up and down it , he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again .
Monte Cristo observed it particularly , and by a look asked the banker for an explanation .
I know nearly one thousand words , which is all that is absolutely necessary , although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries .
It remains now for us to keep our word .
love me too ; I will not torment you much , but only on condition that you become a Frondist , my young friend , and a hearty Frondist , too. ” “ But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse ? ” “ I should say you could !
M. de Tréville had intimated to them his Majesty ’ s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May , and they must immediately prepare their outfits .
At the same moment a violent crash was heard , and cries of distress .
I have made him a spy upon his wife. ” The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great , and retired .
“ Well , what have you to say ?
I will call on you , sir , since you bid me contemplate , for the advantage of my pride , this terrible spectacle , which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family. ” “ It would have been so unquestionably , had not God given me so large a compensation .
Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races , count ? ” “ I shall do whatever they do at Paris , madame , if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement. ” “ Are you fond of horses , count ? ” “ I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East , madame , and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things—the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women. ” “ Nay , count , ” said the baroness , “ it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first. ” “ You see , madame , how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here. ” At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir ; approaching her mistress , she spoke some words in an undertone .
“ So would you ! ” said Mazarin , looking with astonishment at those two men .
“ Yes , I understand , ” was the reply contained in his look ; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation , mixed with profound contempt .

“ Where do you suffer ? ” asked the doctor .
He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather ; the travelers replied .
Alas , to many the path is traced by tears. ” “ Sir , ” said Madame Danglars , “ you can feel for my emotion , can you not ?
“ The Standard. ” “ Very well ; in half an hour we shall be on board. ” And the friends , spurring on their horses , rode to the hotel , the “ Arms of England. ” “ What do you say of that young man ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan , as they hurried along .
Each had his own particular visit to make .
Still further , he had seldom seen the young Musketeer ; but every time he had seen him , he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance .
This was the costume that best became the king .
One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort .
There is but little reason why I should delay you .
I have , during those five-and-twenty years , spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me ; and now , when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach , the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms ! ” “ Sire , it is fatality ! ” murmured the minister , feeling that the pressure of circumstances , however light a thing to destiny , was too much for any human strength to endure .
Well , wait for the miracle I hope to accomplish , or—— ” “ Or ? ” repeated Morrel .
I will go myself and fetch the lemonade. ” D ’ Avrigny bounded towards the door , flew down the back staircase , and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort , in his haste , who was herself going down to the kitchen .
Adieu !
Bonacieux became livid ; a fearful agony pervaded her frame , and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aramis .
In the name of that young lady you love , and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not ! ” cried the bandit , throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand—for he began to lose his strength with his blood .
“ Well , be it so , ” at length said Eugénie ; “ return by the same road you came , and we will say nothing about you , unhappy wretch. ” “ Here he is , here he is ! ” cried a voice from the landing ; “ here he is !
I assure you , Franz and I were lost in admiration. ” “ Nothing more simple , ” returned the count .
Bazin followed him upon a roan , holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse ; this was D ’ Artagnan ’ s mount .
was seen yesterday at Gabrielle ’ s .
We two are worth a dozen. ” “ Yes , ” said Porthos , smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits ; “ but we four , altogether , would be equal to thirty-six , more especially as you say the work will not be child ’ s play .
However , I scold you instead of him , and in his place ; the storm will blow over more easily , believe me .
They soon appeared satisfied and returned ( with the exception of one , who remained at the shore ) to their fire , at which the carcass of a goat was roasting .
The company went on speaking of the poet Voiture .
“ ‘ “ Have you , then , so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know ? ” “ ‘ “ Our coachman is a member of the club , ” said the president ; “ we shall be driven by a State-Councillor. ” “ ‘ “ Then we run another risk , ” said the general , laughing , “ that of being upset. ” We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting , but that he came willingly .
The third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life. ” “ No , no , ” cried Dantès ; “ you are mistaken—you will not die !
Have you , then , who have calculated everything with such nicety , have you forgotten to calculate one thing—I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to ?
Pray forgive me. ” But there was no look calculated to reassure her ; all it seemed to say was , “ It is not only your reserve which afflicts me. ” “ What is it , then ? ” asked the young girl .
“ There is only one thing which grieves me , ” observed the major , “ and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon. ” “ Ah , my dear M. Cavalcanti , I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends. ” “ I am at your service , sir , ” replied the major .
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security .
“ Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy , deep sleep stole over me , and having no suspicion of anything wrong , I sought not to shake it off .
The next day about nine o ’ clock in the morning , he landed at St. Valery .
I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day , ” said Beauchamp ; “ but he is perfectly unknown to me. ” “ Have you mentioned this death in your paper ? ” “ It has been mentioned , but the article is not mine ; indeed , I doubt if it will please M. Villefort , for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king ’ s attorney , he would have interested himself somewhat more about it. ” “ Still , ” said Château-Renaud , “ Dr .
“ Have you so soon changed your mind , ” added Morcerf , “ or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled ? ” Danglars , seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it , the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage , turned to Morcerf , and said : “ Count , you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve , and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you ; but , believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me. ” “ These are all so many empty words , my dear sir , ” said Morcerf : “ they might satisfy a new acquaintance , but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list ; and when a man like him comes to another , recalls to him his plighted word , and this man fails to redeem the pledge , he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing. ” Danglars was a coward , but did not wish to appear so ; he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed .
What the devil !
“ Yes , hell has resuscitated you , ” continued Athos .
Villefort , after having received M. de Salvieux ’ s letter , embraced Renée , kissed the marquise ’ s hand , and shaken that of the marquis , started for Paris along the Aix road .
Ah !
“ I shall get them all in time. ” “ Oh , as for that , ” said Danglars , angry at this prolongation of the jest , — “ as for that you won ’ t get them at all .
Franz and the count advanced , and the bandit saluted them .
But Fernand , instead of responding to this amiable gesture , remained mute and trembling .
The count was alone with Morrel , who remained motionless as a statue .
“ Go , gentlemen , ” he said ; “ you must be much fatigued after your voyage .
Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court , and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux. ” The waiter had no suspicions ; Andrea spoke with perfect composure , he had a cigar in his mouth , and his hands in the pocket of his top coat ; his clothes were fashionably made , his chin smooth , his boots irreproachable ; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late , that was all .
“ Ah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to understand .
“ But you , ” he said , “ with that light dress , and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf , perhaps you feel cold ? ” “ Do you know where I am leading you ? ” said the countess , without replying to the question .
D ’ Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance .
So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character .
“ My lord , ” said the guard , “ I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel , who believes that , be he ever so closely watched and guarded , the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsuntide. ” “ Coysel is a madman ! ” returned the cardinal .
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression .
He strictly followed the instructions he had received .
Look at your brother monarch , Charles I .
Go to him with this letter , and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done. ” Upon which M. d ’ Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son , kissed him tenderly on both cheeks , and gave him his benediction .
Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face , and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch ’ s blood , fell down insensible .
Valentine looked at her watch .
I should like you a hundred times better if , by your intervention , I could manage to remain a bachelor , even were it only for ten years. ” “ Nothing is impossible , ” gravely replied Monte Cristo ; and taking leave of Albert , he returned into the house , and struck the gong three times .
I own myself conquered .
“ I have just left the count , sir , ” said he ; “ he is , doubtless , a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas .
“ You are right , father ; I understand you. ” Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols , he said , “ There is one for you and one for me—thanks ! ” Morrel caught his hand .
This fish , which seems so exquisite to you , is very likely no better than perch or salmon ; but it seemed impossible to procure it , and here it is. ” “ But how could you have these fish brought to France ? ” “ Oh , nothing more easy .
“ Yes ; he appears to be a resolute fellow. ” “ Well , he will do more than he has promised. ” “ He will do wonders then. ” The curate rejoined Planchet , who was waiting for him on the stairs .
Good God ! ” Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger .
Everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues .
At that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as Tréville .
Courtiers , becoming every instant more numerous , succeeded one another , day and night , in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre , in which the cardinal had established his residence .
By no means ; it really seems to me very curious. ” “ Yes , indeed .
Isn ’ t it so , Kitty ? ” “ I do not care where I live , ” said Kitty , “ provided I am well concealed , and nobody knows where I am. ” “ Meanwhile , Kitty , when we are about to separate , and you are no longer jealous of me— ” “ Monsieur Chevalier , far off or near , ” said Kitty , “ I shall always love you. ” “ Where the devil will constancy niche itself next ? ” murmured Athos .
Immediately afterwards the light expired , and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity , while the clock at that minute struck half-past four .
“ No one must disturb us , ” he said ; “ I must speak freely to her , accuse myself , and say ” —he approached the door , touched the crystal handle , which yielded to his hand .
“ Valentine , will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner ? ” Valentine rose , and saluting the count , left the apartment without speaking .
Then I saw no more ; but I heard the noise of breaking furniture .
“ Poor fellow ! ” he exclaimed .
He had passed the night standing , and without sleep .
“ As for me , my heart is overflowing with happiness. ” “ Happy father , happy son ! ” said the count .
Chapter XXV .
“ Do you not see ? ” returned the count , “ that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him ?
Can it be with me ?
Come , Haydée , come ! ” and throwing his arm around the young girl ’ s waist , he pressed the hand of Valentine , and disappeared .
You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw .
“ But , come , ” resumed the Englishman , “ are these men of yours dangerous ? ” “ In what respect ? ” “ Are they capable of attempting violence ? ” D ’ Artagnan burst out laughing at the idea .
“ Doctor , every son of woman is born to suffer and to die ; I am content to suffer and to await death. ” “ Beware , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , “ it may come slowly ; you will see it approach after having struck your father , your wife , perhaps your son. ” Villefort , suffocating , pressed the doctor ’ s arm .
As he was finishing this work , the sound of horses prancing in the yard , and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window , attracted his attention .
As for the count , he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him .
Grimaud gave a grim smile .
But to grieve my father—to disturb my grandmother ’ s last moments—never ! ” “ You are right , ” said Morrel , calmly .
Carefully closing the box door , Ali placed himself before it , while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian .
As to D ’ Artagnan , he took care not to give the least sign of existence .
Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles .
“ Let us go and die with them ! ” said the king .
“ What shall we do ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Why , the same we had intended doing three days since—set off. ” “ What ? —although you are not now going to be married , you intend still—— ” “ Listen , Louise .
I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haydée .
“ After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening ; but this time , as I yielded to fatigue , or as if I had become familiarized with danger , I dragged myself toward my bed , let my robe fall , and lay down .
They fell into the line of carriages .
But this year , ” continued the horticulturist , “ I ’ ll take care it shall not happen , even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe. ” Monte Cristo had seen enough .
“ Alas !
Are there , then , two parliaments ? ” “ My friend , ” D ’ Artagnan interrupted , “ as I don ’ t understand English and we all understand Spanish , have the kindness to speak to us in that language , which , since it is your own , you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance. ” “ Ah !
Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair , without the power of moving .
The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand , and the red light of the fire made them look like demons .
In the long run , a man knows more about politics than a woman , particularly such as , like you , Monsieur Bonacieux , have conversed with the cardinal .
“ This is what I propose to do , ” said Athos .
Is supper ready , Signor Pastrini ? ” “ Yes , your excellency. ” “ Well , then , let us sup. ” “ But the carriage and horses ? ” said Franz .
Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail , and cast a look around .
D ’ Artagnan was looking at Athos , whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king , possessing more self-control , had banished from his own .
At length the light disappeared .
Are you mad , to talk to me thus ? ” said Buckingham .
We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud ; if , as we hope , our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work , they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual , who is wholly unchanged , except that he is twenty years older , an advance in life that has made him only more silent ; although , since the change that had been working in himself , Athos had given Grimaud permission to speak .
He told him his birth , his position , his fortune , and more than once , when he consulted the look of the paralytic , that look answered , “ That is good , proceed. ” “ And now , ” said Morrel , when he had finished the first part of his recital , “ now I have told you of my love and my hopes , may I inform you of my intentions ? ” “ Yes , ” signified the old man .
“ Here ’ s a sword and a dress , ” said Porthos .
Broussel was seated at the table with his family , having his wife opposite to him , his two daughters by his side , and his son , Louvieres , whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor—an accident from which he had quite recovered—at the bottom of the table .
“ Yes , ” said the baron , “ assassinated .
I do assure you , grandpapa—Ah—M .
“ If the reality corresponds with appearances I am lost ; for a man so well off will never change his happy condition , and I shall fail with him , as I have already done with Aramis. ” Chapter XI .
And yet , if she were a man she would attempt all this , and perhaps might succeed ; why , then , did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body ?
“ Do you not know the race ? ” said he .
“ Tell her grace , ” replied Athos , “ that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes. ” Then , with renewed instructions to Grimaud , Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment .
Consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf , he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom I announced your promised visit , and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person .
Then , casting a glance on the handsome young man , who was scarcely twenty-five years of age , and whom he was leaving in his gore , deprived of sense and perhaps dead , he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist .
This army is commanded by a butcher , or the son of a butcher—it matters little—Colonel Harrison .
“ Here is M. Franz d ’ Épinay , ” said he ; “ you requested to see him .
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Tréville being paid , the pensive D ’ Artagnan took the longest way homeward .
Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so .
As certainly , Maximilian , as I now press your hand , I shall kill him before ten o ’ clock tomorrow morning. ” Morrel , in his turn , took Monte Cristo ’ s hand in both of his , and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was .
“ It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day , in the garden of the Hôtel des Postes , when chance brought us together ; you , Madame de Villefort , and her son ; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you. ” “ I perfectly well remember Perugia , sir , and the Hôtel des Postes , and the festival of which you speak , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ but in vain do I tax my memory , of whose treachery I am ashamed , for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before. ” “ It is strange , but neither do I recollect meeting with you , ” observed Valentine , raising her beautiful eyes to the count .
“ To the sloop , ” said Felton , “ and row quickly. ” The four men bent to their oars , but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it .
His gravity made him look older than he was. ” “ Well then , if we can get Athos , all will be well .
Here is a beautiful lawn ; let us go on straight forwards. ” Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow , but obeyed ; however , he continued to take the left hand .
on !
Read , then !
“ And yet , notwithstanding these precautions , I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind .
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter , she placed herself at the table and ate .
It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic , and the way in which he had achieved the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased Edmond ’ s admiration of him ; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit , supposing it had ever existed , still existed ; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical , he yet believed it was no longer there .
“ Oh , yes , ” was the ready answer .
Albert was silent ; an instant after , the countess resumed : “ You came to inquire after my health ; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well .
“ What papers ? ” “ The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari , and the register of your child ’ s birth. ” “ The register of my child ’ s birth ? ” “ The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti—of your son ; is not his name Andrea ? ” “ I believe so , ” said the major .
Now , I travel a great deal , particularly on this road , and I wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune. ” “ It seems to me , ” said the host , “ that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsieur. ” “ Bah , I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly , and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least .
It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday , near the gate St. Honoré. ” “ No , upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman , I bought it with the contents of my own purse , ” answered he whom they designated by the name Porthos .
She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly—for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky , and distant lightning announced a storm .
He would fain have continued , but his knees trembled , and his heart beat so violently , and his sight became so dim , that he was forced to pause .
But , once started , he could not stop .
The handsome Madeleine announced to D ’ Artagnan that Planchet had returned , bringing Mousqueton with him , who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit .
But even while they watched his daring progress , Edmond ’ s foot slipped , and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear .
Surely , if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon , I ought to be forgiven. ” Then , as if his strength failed him , he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head , which drowned his voice .
My apartment will be close to his .
La Ramee !
Of course , we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old ; and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter. ” “ What was his name ? ” inquired the count , who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccio ’ s story .
He made fruitless efforts to go on ; it was impossible .
We left Paris , each with seventy-five pistoles in his pocket. ” “ Shall I see you again before your departure ? ” “ I think not , monsieur , unless something new should happen. ” “ Well , a pleasant journey. ” “ Thanks , monsieur. ” D ’ Artagnan left M. de Tréville , touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his Musketeers .
“ You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont , Henrietta ! ” said the queen .
He no longer feared realities , but phantoms .
“ Good news !
what will they leave him ?
It is , then , Buckingham ! ” cried Felton , in a high state of excitement .
Really , count , if ever I thought that I had a friend in the ranks of the royal army , it was you .
Bazin , my friend , come here. ” The door opened and Bazin entered ; on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair .
“ When a carriage is chosen , it ought to be strong .
I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory way. ” “ Let us see , ” said Aramis , “ how are we to act ? ” “ I have arranged two plans .
“ Oh , Faria , Faria , how well did you judge men and things ! ” “ What did you please to say , sir ? ” asked Caderousse .
I see !
You pretend to pardon me , and you poison me ! ” “ I ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
Athos required no more .
What is to be done ? ” “ My God , my God ! ” murmured the young woman , “ ought I to confide such a secret to you , monsieur ?
Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or dressing-case. ” And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting-cards , and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each , payable at sight to the bearer .
She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago .
Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre , where they had as yet but partisans ; and he , Richelieu—the French minister , the national minister—would be ruined .
As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten , he was told that Lord Wilmore , who was precision and punctuality personified , was not yet come in , but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck .
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to D ’ Artagnan , and a well-known voice said , “ Monsieur , I have brought your cloak ; it is chilly this evening. ” “ Planchet ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , beside himself with joy .
Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped , like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net , and so help me out of prison. ” “ Briefly , what did you learn ? ” “ That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o ’ clock , as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great festivals .
but I doubt that your object was like theirs—to rescue the Holy Sepulchre. ” “ You are quite right , Beauchamp , ” observed the young aristocrat .
The prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust .
Have you that means ? ” “ It is to be found for the searching .
Everybody looked and listened with astonishment , comprehending nothing of what passed .
D ’ Artagnan remained standing and examined this man .
It would be exceedingly droll. ” The Gascon , with his vivid imagination , had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation .
Chapter IV .
But listen !
They found him holding his leave of absence in one hand , and M. de Tréville ’ s note in the other .
As for Andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to scold his groom , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it .
“ Well , ” asked the abbé , as he returned to the apartment below , “ what have you made up your mind to do ? ” “ To tell you all I know , ” was the reply .
Send him away and all will then be well. ’ ” “ What do you wish me to do ? ” “ Oh , madame !
“ Yes , but he couldn ’ t understand what it meant , for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his return. ” “ You must know , monsieur , that Marie Michon , when she returned to France in 1643 , immediately sought for information about that child ; as a fugitive she could not take care of it , but on her return she wished to have it near her. ” “ And what said the abbé ? ” asked Athos .
You were among them—you were !
It closed after him with a spring .
You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England , ” added she , with a melancholy smile , “ and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto. ” “ I am completely ignorant of it , madame , ” said the cardinal , accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders ; “ alas , our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor , incapable , infirm old minister like me. ” “ Well , then , your eminence , ” said the queen , “ I must inform you that Charles I. , my husband , is on the eve of a decisive engagement .
Uncertainty is still hope. ” Then in a low voice Morrel added , — “ This delay is not natural .
I am a machine then , and nothing else , and so long as I work , nothing more is required of me. ” “ Is it possible , ” said Monte Cristo to himself , “ that I can have met with a man that has no ambition ?
They carried Valentine away ; she had revived , but could scarcely move or speak , so shaken was her frame by the attack .
This morning the subject was introduced , and my dear grandmother , on whom I depended as my only support , not only declared herself favorable to it , but is so anxious for it , that they only await the arrival of M. d ’ Épinay , and the following day the contract will be signed. ” A deep sigh escaped the young man , who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved .
“ Let me see , ” continued the stranger , “ I am one of your largest creditors. ” “ Your bills , at least , are the first that will fall due. ” “ Do you wish for time to pay ? ” “ A delay would save my honor , and consequently my life. ” “ How long a delay do you wish for ? ” Morrel reflected .
The abbess listened more attentively , grew animated by degrees , and smiled .
But my lord , tell me , ” she continued , “ hide nothing from me—what is , in truth , the king ’ s position ?
Instead of improving these gifts , rarely granted so abundantly , this has been your course—you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness , and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend. ” “ Help ! ” cried Caderousse ; “ I require a surgeon , not a priest ; perhaps I am not mortally wounded—I may not die ; perhaps they can yet save my life. ” “ Your wounds are so far mortal that , without the three drops I gave you , you would now be dead .
“ Oh !
All he possessed was 15,257 francs .
I am ready .

I let him place the box in the hole he had made , then , while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation , I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast , exclaiming : “ ‘ I am Giovanni Bertuccio ; thy death for my brother ’ s ; thy treasure for his widow ; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped. ’ “ I know not if he heard these words ; I think he did not , for he fell without a cry .
Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin , the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie .
I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o ’ clock , when I caught sight of your carriage and horses. ” “ What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me. ” 40092m “ No , thank you , I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now ; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company. ” “ What on earth are you talking of ? ” “ I am to fight today. ” “ For what ? ” “ For the sake of fighting ! ” “ Yes , I understand that , but what is the quarrel ?
“ Then , if he should forget that visit , you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it ? ” “ Not at all. ” “ Ah , that gives me more confidence. ” This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascon ’ s soul .
27 , ” said the inspector .
Come here , fellow. ” Bazin , who was crossing the ante-chamber majestically in his clerical dress , turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him ; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them .
The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy ; in fact , he did not notice the offered hand .
A leather pocketbook , a purse , in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received , with a dice box and dice , completed the possessions of the dead man .
I should lose myself in the cardinal ’ s opinion .
monsieur ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I beg you will have a care what you say ; for if you utter another word like that , be you marquis , duke , prince or king , I will thrust it down your throat !
The gate once closed , and Debray and the baroness alone in the court , he asked : “ What was the matter with you , Hermine ?
Is he still amusing himself in Italy ? ” “ I believe so ; however , he regrets your absence extremely .
In about ten minutes D ’ Artagnan appeared at the door , followed by the inseparable Porthos .
I may then tell the cardinal , with respect to this little woman— ” “ That he may be at ease. ” “ Is that all ? ” “ He will know what that means. ” “ He will guess , at least .
He is a coward. ” “ With women , perhaps ; but not with men .
All this is very sad which you tell me. ” “ What will you ?
Valentine The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece , exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water .
“ It is past noon , ” said she , “ and today is Saturday ; I dare say it is the doctor , grandpapa. ” Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition .
“ The devil ! ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself .
“ Rise , ” said the count , “ your life is safe ; the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices—one is mad , the other dead .
“ This confession , ” said she , growing paler , “ what is this confession ? ” “ You gave De Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room , did you not ? ” “ No , no !
Peppino , who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories , struck a light and lit a torch .
On the right and on the left of the road , which the dismal procession pursued , appeared a few low , stunted trees , which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour .
“ Yes , ” replied the stranger .
I comprehend .
If he could have made any use of me , he would have taken me with him ; he leaves me in Paris , as our separation will conduce to his benefit ; —therefore he has gone , and I am free forever , ” added Madame Danglars , in the same supplicating tone .
“ It is all as he has said ; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor. ” Then , turning towards the paralytic , he said , “ You possess , then , 900,000 francs of capital , which , according to the manner in which you have invested it , ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres ? ” “ Yes. ” “ To whom do you desire to leave this fortune ? ” “ Oh ! ” said Madame de Villefort , “ there is not much doubt on that subject .
Many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me ; so you see in what a situation I am. ” “ Make your complaints known ; that ’ s my advice. ” “ Listen , Rochefort ; let us make a compact .
The heart breaks when , after having been elated by flattering hopes , it sees all its illusions destroyed .
“ And if I refuse to retract , you wish to fight , do you ? ” said Beauchamp in a calm tone .
Listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him ; one takes away from him all claim to good sense , another robs him of his poetry , a third of his originality , another of his humor , another of his independence of character , a sixth—but , good heavens !
“ Eh , ” he said , negligently , “ this money is not mine .
I have blessed you and you are sacred to me .
wait ! ” said Aramis ; “ that is an idea ! ” “ Of which I invite you to take advantage , my friend .
Has Bedeau been killed ?
I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance .
D ’ Artagnan said nothing , but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake .
The dog sprang , and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it .
“ Mademoiselle , ” said Eugénie , “ let the porter get the post-chaise from the coach-house , and fetch some post-horses from the hotel .
“ Well , what is it—what is going on here ? ” said he , in a jeering voice , on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out .
Nothing , ” said Milady , smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile .
Was that it ? ” “ If , God willing , these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I shall venture to express a wish , which is , that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy—for with these three men your eminence may rouse all Europe if you like. ” “ These Gascons , ” said the cardinal , laughing , “ almost beat the Italians in effrontery. ” “ At all events , ” answered D ’ Artagnan , with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal ’ s , “ they beat them when they draw their swords. ” He then withdrew , and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money .
M. Noirtier ? ” “ Yes ; think you it was the poor servant ’ s life was coveted ?
As he stooped down to drink , he saw that his hair had become entirely white .
This island was , always had been , and still is , completely deserted .
But I forgot , ” added the Gascon , smiling , “ pardon , I forgot you are no longer Athos ; but never mind , let us hear your plan for dinner , Porthos. ” “ My plan ! ” “ Yes , have you a plan ? ” “ No !
One of the culprits will be _mazzolato_ ; 3 he is an atrocious villain , who murdered the priest who brought him up , and deserves not the smallest pity .
If he comes out we shall catch him .
Comminges saw that he was undecided .
If you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this , you might have saved yourself the trouble .
Yet you have need , I believe , to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken ; for , if I mistake not , you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune. ” “ I am at the age of extravagant hopes , monseigneur , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
It is you who , sent by him to Constantinople , to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor , brought back a false mandate granting full pardon !
Please follow me , ” and he went on before , followed by Athos and Aramis .
Here ’ s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath , and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby .
“ ‘ And follow me wherever I go ? ’ “ ‘ To the world ’ s end. ’ “ ‘ Then take my arm , and let us on ; we have no time to lose. ’ “ The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her , for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome , proud , and powerful as a god .
Oh , I repeat it , Edmond ; what you have just done is beautiful—it is grand ; it is sublime. ” “ Do you say so now , Mercédès ? —then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you ?
Believe me , we are as well informed as you , and our police are as good as your own .
Bonacieux , and was , as we have said , close to her , he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief , which he picked up , as was his habit , and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other ’ s throat .
“ I not only promise , but swear it ! ” said Monte Cristo extending his hand .
there ’ s the sun !
I obey my captain ’ s orders .
Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day , both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents ; nor did he say more than the truth , for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved , he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection .
At the sixtieth minute of this hour , if the money is not forthcoming , he blows out the prisoner ’ s brains with a pistol-shot , or plants his dagger in his heart , and that settles the account. ” “ Well , Albert , ” inquired Franz of his companion , “ are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall ? ” “ Quite so , ” said Albert , “ if the way be picturesque. ” The clock struck nine as the door opened , and a coachman appeared .
The door being closed , the four friends waited in expectation .
The neighbors who had opened their windows , with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances , closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee—their instinct telling them that for the time all was over .
Danglars was tired and sleepy ; he therefore went to bed , placing his pocketbook under his pillow .
Chapter XXXII .
“ Yes ; about in the same manner , ” said another Musketeer , “ that I bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one. ” “ It ’ s true , though , ” said Porthos ; “ and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for it. ” The wonder was increased , though the doubt continued to exist .
And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her , and where Luigi awaited her .
At daybreak D ’ Artagnan entered the chamber , and demanded what was to be done .
M. de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow .
The house was of white stone , and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers .
Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from Palestrina to Borgo ; every day , at nine o ’ clock in the morning , the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside , and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest ’ s breviary .
“ For all , even for myself among the rest , ” replied Villefort .
She saw nothing ; she listened , and she heard nothing .
Never had he been so well received .
“ Ah , ” replied he , sighing , “ that is not very surprising ; I have been more than a year absent from Paris , and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut ; the count takes me for a provincial .
It is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers , and my cashier was quite proud of it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were .
Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance , poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand ; then hastily swallowing it , went to sit down at the first vacant place , and this was , by mere chance , placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting , when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès .
“ Under the other cardinal , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , “ we didn ’ t know enough to make our profits ; this , however , doesn ’ t concern you , with your forty thousand francs income , the happiest man in the world , it seems to me. ” Porthos sighed .
“ And very princely , ” added Château-Renaud .
“ Come , come , ” said the sailor , “ I have a better opinion than you of women in general , and of Mercédès in particular ; and I am certain that , captain or not , she will remain ever faithful to me. ” “ So much the better—so much the better , ” said Caderousse .
When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed , he turned towards the wounded man .
He brought him also the amount of his wages , which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply for .
He wished to see everything .
“ Sir , ” said he to Danglars , “ understand that I do not take a final leave of you ; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just , and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo. ” He bowed to the banker , and went out with Beauchamp , without appearing to notice Cavalcanti .
“ I have my sword. ” “ And no one waiting for you outside ? ” “ No. ” “ Then you had better come with me. ” “ Thank you , sir , but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to lose. ” Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it .
But you , ” continued M. Bonacieux , in a tone of perfect good fellowship , “ what has become of you all these days ?
D ’ Artagnan determined upon his course .
was going when he was assassinated. ” Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet , for she was always very much the fashion .
“ And now , gentlemen , that ’ s well , ” continued the cardinal .
‘ And yours ? ’ “ ‘ I , ’ said the traveller , ‘ am called Sinbad the Sailor. ’ ” Franz d ’ Épinay started with surprise .
The Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing was said of it. ” “ Ah , things go on gaily , then , ” said Porthos .
“ Oh , God ! ” prayed the kneeling suppliant , “ protect my husband , guard my son , and take my wretched life instead ! ” “ Oh , God ! ” murmured the girl , “ leave me my mother ! ” “ Your mother can be of no use to you in this world , Henrietta , ” said the lady , turning around .
Franz thanked the count for his attention .
The author of this history , who has resided five or six years in Italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries .
“ The fate , ” replied he , smiling , “ of those who buried Alaric , and were interred with the corpse. ” “ Yet , had he come , ” thought Dantès , “ he would have found the treasure , and Borgia , he who compared Italy to an artichoke , which he could devour leaf by leaf , knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock .
you can ride , you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people .
Grimaud ’ s first intention had been to return to Paris , but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul , and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour ’ s riding would unite them , and that the going , returning and explanation would not occupy an hour , he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazingarbe .
“ Well , then ? ” said Aramis .
“ Well , then , off to the nearest goldsmith ’ s , and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him .
In the first horseman she recognized D ’ Artagnan .
Like all persons of real genius , Milady knew what suited her nature and her means .
The two piastres that Luigi received every month from the Count of San-Felice ’ s steward , and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome , were expended in ear-rings , necklaces , and gold hairpins .
The table and chair had nothing , the pail had once possessed a handle , but that had been removed .
Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of Charlemagne , in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model .
However , Raoul must be diverted from this fancy .
And so Dantès , after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo , remained in his dungeon , forgotten of earth and heaven .
“ Yes , before witnesses. ” “ Oh , this is very interesting , ” said Debray ; “ if there really has been a crime , we will investigate it. ” “ There has been a crime , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Keep near me , ” said the latter .
“ But , ” said Debray to Beauchamp , “ if I spoke to the president , _you_ must have been with the procureur. ” “ It was an impossibility ; for the last week M. de Villefort has secluded himself .
When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadjutor .
Oh , believe me , that when three great passions , such as sorrow , love , and gratitude fill the heart , _ennui_ can find no place. ” “ You are a worthy daughter of Epirus , Haydée , and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace .
Nobody knew a word of this enigma .
If Bonacieux knew where his wife was , one might , by extreme means , force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape .
“ I disturb you , perhaps , my dear Aramis , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , “ for by what I see , I am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen. ” Aramis colored imperceptibly .
At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived , accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten followers .
Bravo !
“ Is the baroness at home ? ” inquired Danglars .
“ The young king would , perhaps , show us some gratitude ; but the queen would never forgive us , and it is she whom we have to consider .
Who could intercept us on such a night as this , pitch dark , when one does not see more than twenty yards before one ? ” “ Yes , but to-morrow morning—— ” “ To-morrow we shall be at Boulogne. ” “ I hope so , with all my heart , ” said the Gascon , “ and I confess my weakness .
But this unexpected , unhoped-for , unheard-of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it ; you wished to double it , and how ? —by a murder !
But Vampa raised his head proudly ; as to Teresa , her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold .
The curtain was drawn , and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open , and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man .
At the first glance , D ’ Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy .
He was like a soldierly automaton , or rather , like a magnificent marionette .
Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating heart , and looked through the small opening in the gate ; there was yet no one to be seen .
As for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert , and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing , and on which a few fishing-boats , with their white sails , were alone visible .
de Villefort , the king ’ s attorney ?
“ I have given the signal. ” “ For what ? ” “ For the barricades .
He passed through several apartments , of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea , and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness .
The carriage went on , and left the two men facing each other ; no material obstacle separated them .
“ My dear friend , ” said the baroness , while the two young people were shaking hands , “ I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti. ” Danglars kept up the title of prince .
Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played , drank , sang , but that whilst playing , drinking , singing , he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at Vincennes .
What does the executioner ?
Believe me , it is only the evil-minded who deny friendship ; they can not understand it .
“ It is war , ” said the prince .
At last , after renewed hesitation , Dantès entered the second grotto .
20035m “ Here is , ” said the Englishman , taking a quantity of papers from his pocket , “ an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville , the inspector of prisons , to whom they are due .
Now an Englishman is an enemy ; this port wine belongs to the English , therefore it belongs to us. ” “ And our masters ? ” asked Blaisois , stupefied by this harangue , delivered with an air of profound sagacity , “ will they be of your opinion ? ” Mousqueton smiled disdainfully .
“ Come , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , who , irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts , “ you have never found yourself the worse for my advice .
call the viscount and take the musket with you. ” Blaisois was the tall youth , half groom , half peasant , whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne , whom Athos had christened by the name of his province .
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued , and having reached it , he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone .
Did you come to Noisy to defend him ? ” “ I am waiting for no one , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , who was beginning to be angry .
He was without a hat , carried a sword , and flourished a handkerchief in his hand .
All around him were lying the Palikares , writhing in convulsive agonies , while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows .
“ Sir , ” cried Morrel , seizing the moist hand of the paralytic , “ they ask me who I am , and what right I have to be here .
A man was introduced of simple mien , who had the appearance of a tradesman .
The cardinal made an approving gesture , and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming .
“ You have , perhaps , no money ? ” “ _Perhaps_ is too much , ” said D ’ Artagnan , smiling .
You will have to find the Abbé Busoni ; and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare .
At the end of a year Dantès was a new man .
Well , then , he deputes me to give you this. ” “ Am I to consider this as part of my income on account ? ” “ No , it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris. ” “ Ah , how good my dear father is ! ” “ Silence , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ he does not wish you to know that it comes from him. ” “ I fully appreciate his delicacy , ” said Andrea , cramming the notes hastily into his pocket .
Noble heart ! ” murmured D ’ Artagnan .
When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz , the pupil of M. Noirtier ’ s eye began to dilate , and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak , and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his son .
Ah !
I felt , in bending my head toward you , your beautiful hair touch my cheek ; and every time that it touched me I trembled from head to foot .
Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other , and was about to cut up the fowl .
“ Well , ” cried Milady , in a sharp voice .
As he had prophesied would be the case , he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg , and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself .
However , he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts .
“ I can imagine the effect , I do not see the means. ” “ I will find the means myself. ” “ You are aware it will be war , civil war , furious , devouring , implacable ? ” “ Oh !
Had stolen away this child , in order that your name might become extinct. ” “ That is reasonable , since he is an only son. ” “ Well , now that all is arranged , do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten .
“ You will find me ready to follow you. ” They took leave of each other , and in ten minutes , after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin , D ’ Artagnan was trotting along in the direction of Amiens .
Parry closed the door and approaching the king , his face radiant with joy : “ Sire , ” he said , in a low voice , “ do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise ? ” “ I ?
This uneasiness , amounting almost to frenzy , arose from the report Morcerf ’ s adventure had made in the world , for the affair at the Opera was generally known .
Nevertheless , day dawned without darkness having brought any accident .
No .
What do you say , M. Cavalcanti ? ” “ Ah , ” said he , “ we have at Pisa , Ugolino ’ s tower ; at Ferrara , Tasso ’ s prison ; at Rimini , the room of Francesca and Paolo. ” “ Yes , but you have not this little staircase , ” said Monte Cristo , opening a door concealed by the drapery .
At the branching off of the road toward Paris , Aramis , who had followed in the cardinal ’ s suite , turned back .
Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed , he related his adventure .
“ In this case , ” replied Caderousse , “ let ’ s have some more wine .
The question , then , was how to change this probability into a certainty .
“ I valued it much , ” said Mazarin , giving a last look at it ; “ nevertheless , I give it to you with great pleasure. ” “ And I , my lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ accept it as it is given .
At last , after traveling two days and a night , they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening , favored by magnificent weather .
Chapter 98 .
The snow was falling thick and icy .
‘ You are at liberty to speak , M. de Morcerf , ’ said the president , as he unsealed the letter ; and the count began his defence , I assure you , Albert , in a most eloquent and skilful manner .
Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis ; then she picked up Friquet .
“ Steps approach—I go—adieu ! ” And Dantès , happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend ’ s mental instability , glided like a snake along the narrow passage ; while Faria , restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity , pushed the stone into place with his foot , and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery .
He knew what were the rights of the great land owners .
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds .
Chapter XLIV .
Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained ; then , when they had passed , he brought up the rear , and on his face was a smile , which , if they could have understood it , would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter .
Some voices passed and faded away , and the sound of a single footstep approached the door .
MILADY ’ S SECRET D ’ Artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to Kitty ’ s chamber , as she endeavored to persuade him to do—and that for two reasons : the first , because by this means he should escape reproaches , recriminations , and prayers ; the second , because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring , if possible , to fathom those of this woman .
“ I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary , who had likewise remarked it .
Albert , Beauchamp , and Château-Renaud remained alone .
Who is he ? ” “ Come , come , you won ’ t tell me you don ’ t know Aramis ? ” “ This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced. ” “ It is the first time , then , that you ever went to that house ? ” “ Undoubtedly. ” “ And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man ? ” “ No. ” “ By a Musketeer ? ” “ No , indeed ! ” “ It was not he , then , you came to seek ? ” “ Not the least in the world .
But all I know , sir , is , that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt .
“ No , count , ” he replied , “ I am the only victim in this case .
As to my arms , it is useless to trouble you about them ; I have them. ” “ A horse for your lackey ? ” resumed the procurator ’ s wife , hesitatingly ; “ but that is doing things in lordly style , my friend. ” “ Ah , madame ! ” said Porthos , haughtily ; “ do you take me for a beggar ? ” “ No ; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse , and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for Mousqueton— ” “ Well , agreed for a pretty mule , ” said Porthos ; “ you are right , I have seen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules .
But Mercédès did not witness his departure , although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantès .
“ What have we all done , then , dear grandpapa ? ” said Valentine ; “ you no longer seem to love any of us ? ” The old man ’ s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife , and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness .
A cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there .
50223m “ Ah , yes ; I see , ” said the count , in a voice hoarse from emotion .
‘ _Pardieu_ , ’ said I , ‘ my good gentleman , I have a horse to sell , too. ’ ‘ Ay , and a very fine one !
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours , and private secretary to the Minister of the Interior .
Mazarin , who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry “ Long live Mazarin , ” and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each , kept one eye on Porthos ; but that gigantic body-guard replied to the look with his great bass voice , “ Be tranquil , my lord , ” and Mazarin became more and more composed .
Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts ; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word ( on which his sense of honor was keen ) kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight .
He had foreseen all .
Ali brought in the coffee .
the axe , an ingenious device , and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is ; you frighten me not , executioner ’ s axe , ” added he , touching it with the cane which he held in his hand , “ and I strike you now , waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return the blow. ” And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on .
‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo , who is now , I believe , in Paris ? ’ “ ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo , my foster-father , has been in Normandy the last three days. ’ “ ‘ Who , then , has counselled you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief .
But she has not died of old age , but of grief ; it appears that since the death of the marquis , which affected her very deeply , she has not completely recovered her reason. ” “ But of what disease , then , did she die ? ” asked Debray .
“ Now , my wife came home four days ago , monsieur .
Request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me ; if so , let dinner be served in her apartments .
Had she betrayed him ?
Here I am , ready to give you any explanation you desire. ” “ Why , ” said Danglars , “ in the letter—I believe I have it about me ” —here he felt in his breast-pocket— “ yes , here it is .
Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo ? ” “ Ah , ” said the count negligently , looking attentively at Morcerf , “ is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo ? ” “ Yes , ” returned Franz , finding that the count was coming to the point he wished .
He was pale , but calm and collected , and saluting his judge with easy politeness , looked round for a seat , as if he had been in M. Morrel ’ s salon .
The principal thing for her , then , was , as we have said , to keep Mme .
Julie hesitated .
And the four friends rushed out of the fort , gained the field of battle , picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the brigadier , and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city , turned again toward the bastion , bearing with them the trophies of their victory .
Bazin , who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation , sprang toward them , took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit , and walked respectfully before them to clear their way .
He ’ s my friend , and this morning offered to share his money with me , as I shared mine with him .

Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a new blade put to his sword , and then returned toward the Louvre , inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of M. de Tréville , which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier ; that is to say , in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by D ’ Artagnan—a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey .
Humanity , in a battle .
So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the proposition. ” “ Yes , I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt. ” “ On his right and left , sir .
A police agent entered .
Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered , followed by the coadjutor .

“ If his Eminence , ” said he , “ did not have personal motives— ” The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him : “ Pardon me , ” said he ; “ but the instant your Majesty considers me a prejudiced judge , I withdraw. ” “ Come , ” said the king , “ will you swear , by my father , that Athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it ? ” “ By your glorious father , and by yourself , whom I love and venerate above all the world , I swear it. ” “ Be so kind as to reflect , sire , ” said the cardinal .
“ Monsieur Laporte , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king , but they shall see him in bed ; add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence , so as not to awaken him. ” “ But not every one ; a deputation of two or four people. ” “ Every one , madame. ” “ But reflect , they will keep us here till daybreak. ” “ It shall take but a quarter of an hour , I answer for everything , madame ; believe me , I know the people ; they are like a great child , who only wants humoring .
Upon gaining this advantage D ’ Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman !
“ Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference ? ” inquired Aramis , perceiving that people were stopping to look at them , supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far-famed duels still extant in the memory of the Parisians , and especially the inhabitants of the Place Royale .
“ Or from your generosity , my friend ; to so good a marksman as you are , I may say what would appear absurd to another. ” “ What is that ? ” “ Break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him. ” “ I will tell you , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that I do not need entreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf ; he shall be so well spared , that he will return quietly with his two friends , while I—— ” “ And you ? ” “ That will be another thing ; I shall be brought home. ” “ No , no , ” cried Maximilian , quite unable to restrain his feelings .
Bonacieux , and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her , D ’ Artagnan would have returned home , since he had so promised .
27 , in the Rue du Helder , on the 21st of May , at half-past ten in the morning , and your word of honor passed for your punctuality ? ” “ The 21st of May , at half-past ten in the morning , Rue du Helder , No .
The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths , leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers ; for on approaching nearer , instead of one extended figure , the young men discovered two .
“ You will go to London , ” continued the cardinal .
Everyone offered his own .
La Rochelle , which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities , was , then , the focus of dissensions and ambition .
Adieu !
When his patience was exhausted , he called his valet .
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance .
Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel .
Don ’ t make a bad use of it , I entreat you .
Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit .
He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd .
Besides , you forget , Cæsar , an indigestion declares itself immediately , while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two. ’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning , and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner .
In the eyes of many , Benedetto appeared , if not a victim to , at least an instance of , the fallibility of the law .
The silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk , and D ’ Artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand , which , by its form , its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss .
One arm was hanging out of the bed ; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain Pillon ’ s “ Graces , ” 23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion , and the hand , so delicately formed , was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed .
I shall be about again in a few days. ” “ Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris ?
“ You are right ; and upon my soul , I would give my life for a hair , ” said Athos .
They had observed for some time before them , on the horizon , a rather thick wood ; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it , Monsieur d ’ Arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count ’ s two grooms .
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment .
I yesterday took the place of another .
The king , who was entirely surrounded , walked alone in a great empty space .
She told D ’ Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law , and not her brother .
Do I , for instance , fare better ?
Believe me , madame , as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom—a heart devoted to you—believe that you have been the idol of our lives ; that we have , as you well know—good Heaven ! —risked our lives twenty times for your majesty .
“ Let us go , then .
The above-mentioned purchase was made on his highness ’ s account , whose mandate I had , for the sum of four hundred thousand francs .
She will not hear what we say ; she never goes to bed before midnight. ” D ’ Artagnan cast a glance around him .
On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then ; those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers .
“ In that hotel ?
He had gone down about three-quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke .
“ Vitray , ” said he , “ you will go with all speed to London .
There remained , then , no other place to fear but the Traitor ’ s Cross ; the carriage was taking the direct road to it .
“ Cardinalists or Frondeurs , what matters it ?
“ You knew him , ” returned the inspector with a smile .
While we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .
Look at Aramis , now ; Aramis is mildness and grace personified .
His house has been full ever since .
Every transport of a daughter finding a father , all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by Haydée during the first moments of this meeting , which she had so eagerly expected .
“ I must own , ” said Aramis , “ I am like the Comte de la Fere—I can see nothing remarkable about it. ” “ My lord , ” said Athos , “ in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens .
Any other person would , perhaps , have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise ; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister , although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost .
So , my dear viscount , whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me. ” “ I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you , ” said Morcerf .
Your Eminence may perceive , ” continued Athos , knitting his brow , for this sort of investigation began to annoy him , “ that we have not come out without our arms. ” And he showed the cardinal , with his finger , the four muskets piled near the drum , on which were the cards and dice .
For the rest , as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days , if Porthos were still at the Great St. Martin , he would call for him on his way .
In the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim : “ Are you playing with justice , accused , and do you dare set your fellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled ? ” Several persons hurried up to M. de Villefort , who sat half bowed over in his chair , offering him consolation , encouragement , and protestations of zeal and sympathy .
“ Well , well ! ” said he .
The citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime. ” “ And you—do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois ? ” “ Yes , they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body. ” “ How miserable not to be free ! ” “ Don ’ t be downcast .
He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli , who , after becoming a bankrupt , chose to change his name to Emery ; and Cardinal Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude , had introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII .
“ Marie Michon , ” continued Athos .
In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé , Dantès spoke no more of escape .
Besides , you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed. ” “ At what ?
The work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy_ , and will make one large quarto volume. ” “ And on what have you written all this ? ” “ On two of my shirts .
Expiation Chapter 112 .
Now , allowing for contrary winds , accidents , and a woman ’ s weakness , there are twelve days. ” “ Well , Monsieur Duke , ” said the king , “ have you made your calculations ? ” “ Yes , sire .
Ah !
Athos , on quitting Aramis , went to Madame de Chevreuse .
U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff .
Dantès , as we have said , had traced the marks along the rocks , and he had noticed that they led to a small creek , which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph .
Winter , give the necessary orders. ” Winter then left the tent ; in the meantime the king finished his toilet .
For two days no one knew what had become of her , and everything remained in suspense ; but once free , and placed in communication with Laporte , matters resumed their course , and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which , but for her arrest , would have been executed three days earlier .
But to return to our duchess. ” “ Which—the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville ? ” “ Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville ?
Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me ? ” “ How , dear sister ! ” said Lord de Winter .
She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years , with dark hair , blue eyes , and a nose slightly turned up , admirable teeth , and a complexion marbled with rose and opal .
Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M—— !
This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans ; it was an entire army .
She lived in a small town with her brother , who was a curate .
“ No , I remain , ” replied Athos , with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed .
Whither art thou going , Grimaud ? ” “ To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders , your honor. ” They were taking the road toward Paris , when groans , which seemed to proceed from a ditch , attracted their attention .
If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business , you must assist me by the most minute information on every point. ” “ Pray ask me whatever questions you please ; for , in good truth , you see more clearly into my life than I do myself. ” “ In the first place , then , who examined you , —the king ’ s attorney , his deputy , or a magistrate ? ” “ The deputy. ” “ Was he young or old ? ” “ About six or seven-and-twenty years of age , I should say. ” “ So , ” answered the abbé .
de Guise ?
I am not precisely rich , though I am pretty well off. ” “ Hold , madame , ” said Porthos , “ let us say no more upon the subject , I beg of you .
The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion .
30043m “ ‘ A quarter of an hour , ’ was the reply .
to horse ! ” Several horsemen ran quickly to him .
This was a terrible moment for the fugitives .
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand ; her own hands were moist and icy cold .
“ See , Planchet , ” said he , “ these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me , but at bottom they all like you. ” “ Ah , monsieur , ” said Planchet , “ I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters ; and if they do cut me in quarters , be assured that not a morsel of me will speak. ” It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day , at eight o ’ clock in the morning , in order , as he had said , that he might during the night learn the letter by heart .
“ But not until two o ’ clock , ” said D ’ Artagnan , with the same calmness .
All our servants are busy , discussing the grand affair .
He leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom , and in less than a moment , tearing off his cravat , his coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailor ’ s jacket and hat , from beneath which rolled his long black hair .
“ _Pardieu_ , monsieur ! ” said Athos , “ that ’ s a proposition that pleases me ; not that I can accept it , but a league off it savors of the gentleman .
“ My God , can you not remember her name ? ” “ Yes , it was pronounced in my hearing once .
As a skillful general , seeing the enemy ready to surrender , marches toward him with a cry of victory , she rose , beautiful as an antique priestess , inspired like a Christian virgin , her arms extended , her throat uncovered , her hair disheveled , holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast , her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan , and went toward him , crying out with a vehement air , and in her melodious voice , to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy : “ Let this victim to Baal be sent , To the lions the martyr be thrown !
The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night .
“ This communication , ” continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , “ will , we are sure , meet with your approbation. ” The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more .
The Absolution .
As for Franz , he examined his arms with the utmost coolness ; he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle ; he loaded them , looked at the priming , and waited quietly .
“ This Milady , this woman , this creature , this demon , has a brother-in-law , as I think you told me , D ’ Artagnan ? ” “ Yes , I know him very well ; and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister-in-law. ” “ There is no harm in that .
I see you to tell you that everything separates us—the depths of the sea , the enmity of kingdoms , the sanctity of vows .
As for Andrea , he was launched , and when he was once launched nothing stopped him .
On the other hand , Mazarin , present at that audience , heard very well what those deputies demanded .
If she dislikes that so much , why did she ever marry herself ? ” “ You do not understand me , Maximilian .
“ Your history is a terrible one , Mr. Mordaunt , and touches me keenly ; but happily for you , you serve an all-powerful master ; he ought to aid you in your search ; we have so many means of gaining information. ” “ My lord , to a well-bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track ; he is certain to reach the other. ” “ But this relation you mentioned—do you wish me to speak to him ? ” said Mazarin , who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwell ’ s person .
The next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary ; the first will was torn up and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine , on condition that she should never be separated from him .
From this moment I become your friend , and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in yours. ” “ Madame , ” replied Athos , “ I have only to ask your majesty ’ s prayers. ” “ And I , ” said Aramis , “ I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve. ” The queen held out her hand , which they kissed , and she said in a low tone to De Winter : “ If you need money , my lord , separate the jewels I have given you ; detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew .
Allow me to ask you a question : Where are the plenipotentiaries ? ” “ At Charenton , in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of Paris. ” “ And was this conference arranged beforehand ? ” “ No , gentlemen , it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians. ” Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles ; for they well knew what those propositions were , to whom they had been made and who had made them .
The harlequin had reassumed her peasant ’ s costume , and as she passed she raised her mask .
“ Ali , ” observed his master , as the Nubian entered the chamber , “ you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso , have you not ? ” Ali drew himself up proudly , and then returned a sign in the affirmative .
As to Athos , he went out without any mystery , took his horse , which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters , in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return , carefully examined the priming of his pistols , drew his sword , and took , like a forlorn hope , the road to the camp .
D ’ Artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver .
“ Well , ” said the prisoner , when the door was shut , “ I am not so far advanced as I believed .
“ These are melancholy doings , your reverence , which always fall again upon the poor .
At the sixth cabaret , then , as we said , D ’ Artagnan stopped , asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality , and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room , determined thus to wait till daylight ; but this time again his hopes were disappointed , and although he listened with all his ears , he heard nothing , amid the oaths , coarse jokes , and abuse which passed between the laborers , servants , and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part , which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him .
Besides , what is required of a young man in Paris ?
“ I thank you , madame , ” said he , “ for the deference you have shown to my wishes , but I think you want two of the studs , and I bring them back to you. ” With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him .
“ Pardon , pardon , my officer , and I will tell you all. ” “ Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it ? ” asked the young man , withholding his arm .
Yes , I will not deny it , I do await , and I do love him of whom you speak ; and , if he does not return , instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate , I will tell you that he died loving me and me only. ” The young girl made a gesture of rage .
Not at all .
At four o ’ clock , as we have already stated , the mysterious personage arrived .
At half past seven the retreat was sounded .
Danglars ’ feelings were hurt , and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute , the banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word .
The count is in fashion ; I congratulate him upon it. ” “ And have you replied to everyone as you have to me ? ” “ Ah , to be sure , I have not answered you ; be satisfied , we shall have this ‘ lion ’ ; we are among the privileged ones. ” “ Were you at the Opera yesterday ? ” “ No. ” “ He was there. ” “ Ah , indeed ?
The first opportunity you have , confirm her in her opinion ; it will be easy for you , as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other. ” “ I thank you for the warning , ” said the count ; “ I shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions. ” “ You will , then , come on Saturday ? ” “ Yes , since Madame de Morcerf invites me. ” “ You are very kind. ” “ Will M. Danglars be there ? ” “ He has already been invited by my father .
When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard , of which the lock was difficult , the person was pricked by this small point , and died next day .
Then , as we have said , the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier .
“ I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them .
Arrived in his bedroom , the count motioned to Ali to stop ; then he passed into the dressing-room , which he examined .
One might have supposed him thunderstruck ; a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin , but disappeared immediately .
“ Where are you going , marechal ? ” asked the queen .
Conjecture soon became certainty , for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz , gradually emerging from the staircase opposite , upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness .
“ Oh , you do not mean that , ” said he ; “ besides , here comes the confirmation of my assertion. ” Baptistin entered , and remained standing at the door .
Monte Cristo , thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family , departed , murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar , “ Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit ; happy is he who , after having watched its silent growth , is permitted to gather and call it his own. ” The carriage was prepared according to orders , and stepping lightly into it , the count drove off at his usual rapid pace .
“ As the count was immensely rich , excepting the danger Carmela had run , —and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped , made that appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune , —the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle .
I once bore another , which you knew , but you have certainly forgotten it. ” “ Tell it me , sir. ” “ Formerly , ” said the count , “ I was Athos. ” Madame de Chevreuse looked astonished .
“ What think you , Danglars , ” said one of the party , turning towards him , “ of this event ? ” “ Why , ” replied he , “ I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband. ” “ But how could he have done so without your knowledge , Danglars , since you are the ship ’ s supercargo ? ” “ Why , as for that , I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden .
The Colosseum Chapter 35 .
Do you wish to destroy me ? ” “ You see very plainly that there is still danger for you , since a single word makes you tremble ; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined .
On my honor , they are not poisoned .
It appeared , then , to D ’ Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask , and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon .
“ Come , Laporte , ” said the queen .
It was a _coupé_ of Koller ’ s building , and with horses and harness for which Drake had , to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris , refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas .
“ I believe everything , ” said Athos , biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing .
He raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out , saw the monk , and fell back upon the litter , his face illumined by joy .
Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us ? ” “ Oh ! ” cried Porthos , “ oh !
“ Without reckoning , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that all his fortune will come to you , and justly too , since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only daughter .
Lastly , he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near .
Adieu , count , till to-morrow. ” “ But the night is dark , ” said Athos , perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear ; “ and you have no servant. ” “ I have Tony , a safe if simple youth. ” “ Halloo , there , Grimaud , Olivain , and Blaisois !
“ MILADY DE —— “ BOULOGNE , evening of the twenty-fifth .
Lying dressed upon his bed , the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart .
The emperor , now king of the petty Island of Elba , after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world , counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls , —after having been accustomed to hear the “ _Vive Napoléons_ ” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings , uttered in ten different languages , —was looked upon here as a ruined man , separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne .
All at once she paused , a livid flash darted from her eyes ; she ran to the table , emptied into Mme .
It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander ; he dismounted and entered .
“ And make La Ramee eat the pear , ” answered Grimaud .
He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself , devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition ; he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission .
Besides , you can tell them that you have full confidence in me , and they will not be more incredulous than you. ” “ I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days , that is all—to Athos , whose wound still makes him suffer , to go to the waters of Forges ; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend , whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition .
“ No one has come out , ” he replied .
The superior met her ; Milady showed her the cardinal ’ s order .
The queen , on her part , thus chided , softened immediately and sat down , and in an almost weeping voice , letting her arms fall by her side , said : “ Pardon me , sir , and attribute this violence to what I suffer .
really ! ” exclaimed Porthos , opening his great wondering eyes .
de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Suddenly ? ” “ From an apoplectic stroke. ” “ An apoplectic stroke ? ” repeated the doctor .
He will spoil the feast. ” “ I will direct him to stand behind your chair , and since he doesn ’ t speak , your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away. ” “ Do you know , my friend , I find one thing very evident in all this , you distrust me. ” “ My lord , the day after to-morrow is Pentecost. ” “ Well , what is Pentecost to me ?
“ Ah , but you are joking , my worthy man ! ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Alas , sir , ” exclaimed Barrois , “ a great misfortune has happened .
The Fronde is a comedy , of which the first act only is played .
Chapter XXI .
D ’ Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket .
“ Well ? ” eagerly demanded all his three friends .
“ Will these be in your way ? ” he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; “ if so , they can be tied up. ” Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman .
If they meant to execute him at La Grêve , it could scarcely be worth while to gag him , as they had nearly reached the place of execution .
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund .
“ Ah , yes , ” he said , as if awaking from a dream .
“ It is well , madame , I believe your oath. ” “ No , no , read , ” exclaimed the queen , indignantly ; “ read , I command you , for I am resolved that everything shall be finished to-night and never will I recur to this subject again .
“ Shall I go and offer her my services ? ” thought he .
“ But what are you going to fight about , Athos ? ” asked Aramis .
At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out , surrounding the two Frenchmen .
“ No ; I must leave you at ten o ’ clock. ” “ Your engagement was for breakfast , then ? ” said the count .
“ They have abducted her , ” added the commissary ; “ and do you know the man who has committed this deed ? ” “ I think I know him. ” “ Who is he ? ” “ Remember that I affirm nothing , Monsieur the Commissary , and that I only suspect. ” “ Whom do you suspect ?
The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me , the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people. ” “ That ’ s right ! ” cried Morrel .
“ Attention , Porthos ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
“ I am young and strong ; I believe I am courageous , and since yesterday I have learned the power of will .
Chapter 13 .
As for you , you have acted like a barmaid .
He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament ; then he re-opened them , and stood motionless with amazement .
He thought how one day , in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed , he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor .
Embrace also our good and brave Porthos .
“ A man whose name is Franz d ’ Épinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them. ” “ No , he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you. ” “ Ah , this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus , a Perseus freeing Andromeda. ” “ No , he is a man about my own size. ” “ Armed to the teeth ? ” “ He had not even a knitting-needle. ” “ But he paid your ransom ? ” “ He said two words to the chief and I was free. ” “ And they apologized to him for having carried you off ? ” said Beauchamp .
Scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye .
’ Tis not for me , a private individual , to disunite a queen from her kingdom .
Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever , went into his office as usual , came to his breakfast punctually , and then , after dinner , he placed his daughter beside him , took her head in his arms , and held her for a long time against his bosom .
He would at once approach Valentine ’ s father and acknowledge all , begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts .
“ Well , ” said D ’ Artagnan to Athos , “ you see , my dear friend , that this is war to the death. ” Athos shook his head .
By whom did the queen send you this jewel ? ” “ She gave it to me herself. ” “ Where ? ” “ In the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet. ” “ How ? ” “ Giving me her hand to kiss. ” “ You have kissed the queen ’ s hand ? ” said M. de Tréville , looking earnestly at D ’ Artagnan .
“ On reflection , my dear Du Vallon , it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere , and gives good reason to hope .
In a word , the island was inhabited , yet Edmond felt himself alone , guided by the hand of God .
Athos ! ” cried Aramis , with an emotion very rare in him .
“ Hem , ” thought Monte Cristo , “ he begins to conceal his losses ; a month since he boasted of them. ” Then aloud , — “ Oh , madame , M. Danglars is so skilful , he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses elsewhere. ” “ I see that you participate in a prevalent error , ” said Madame Danglars .
“ Order of the king , ” he said .
“ Wretch ! ” she cried , “ will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with ? ” “ I do not say that I did know it , and I do not say that I did not know it .
After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Paulet .
“ I was waiting for you , sir , ” said Mordaunt , raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe .
They looked hesitatingly around them , and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of M. de Tréville ; but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence , and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions .
So they made this song about her : ‘ _Laboissiere , dis moi_. ’ You know it , don ’ t you ? ” “ No , sing it , please. ” Aramis immediately complied , and sang the song in a very lively manner .
Fly , friends , fly ! ” he added , whirling his sword around him .
I ?
how much you have need of me , cunning rogue ! ” thought Gondy .
“ The two things agree marvelously well. ” “ I am all attention , ” said D ’ Artagnan .

my mother , ” cried Mordaunt , with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint , “ I can only offer thee one victim , but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen ! ” And whilst D ’ Artagnan uttered a cry , Porthos raised the oar , and Aramis sought a place to strike , a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated Athos into the sea ; whilst Mordaunt , with a shout of triumph , grasped the neck of his victim , and in order to paralyze his movements , twined arms and legs around the musketeer .

“ ‘ Signed , Beaurepaire , Duchampy , and Lecharpal. ’ ” When Franz had finished reading this account , so dreadful for a son ; when Valentine , pale with emotion , had wiped away a tear ; when Villefort , trembling , and crouched in a corner , had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man , — “ Sir , ” said d ’ Épinay to Noirtier , “ since you are well acquainted with all these details , which are attested by honorable signatures , —since you appear to take some interest in me , although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow , refuse me not one final satisfaction—tell me the name of the president of the club , that I may at least know who killed my father. ” Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door ; Valentine , who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather ’ s answer , and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm , drew back a few steps .

She for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance , impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear .
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair .
a little sooner or a little later , it isn ’ t worth quarreling over. ” “ If I am astonished at anything , ” remarked Porthos , sententiously , “ it is that it has not already happened. ” “ Oh , it will happen , you may be sure , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Parry , ” said the king , rising too , “ my horse ; I desire to go to Thirsk. ” “ Egad ! ” said D ’ Artagnan to Athos , “ your king has thoroughly taken me , and I am quite at his service. ” “ If what you say is sincere , ” replied Athos , “ he will never reach London. ” “ How so ? ” “ Because before then we shall have carried him off. ” “ Well , this time , Athos , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ upon my word , you are mad. ” “ Have you some plan in your head then ? ” asked Aramis .
“ Yes. ” “ Cut the cable , then. ” Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord .
“ No ; before a woman you would dare not fly , I presume ? ” “ Remember , ” said Milady , seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword , “ the least delay may ruin everything. ” “ You are right , ” cried the gentleman ; “ begone then , on your part , and I will depart as quickly on mine. ” And bowing to the lady , he sprang into his saddle , while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses .
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window .

“ Sir , ” said Aramis , “ you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner .
Come !

Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake .
under pretext of trading along the coast , these men , who are in reality smugglers , will prefer selling me to doing a good action .
“ Listen to me , my dear girl , ” said the Gascon , who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos ; “ you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation .
The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it ; he only satisfied himself by Milady ’ s pulse that the case was not serious .
I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me .
In the evening , on his return , Franz found a letter from the embassy , informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day .
“ Oh !
“ And pray what do you call such an action ? ” “ But who said it was buried alive ? ” “ Why bury it there if it were dead ?

Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act , and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given .
Only remember this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear ( for you will look and you will listen , I am quite sure , however we may threaten you ) , you are lost. ’ At these words he threw me a crown , which I picked up , and he took the ladder .
You have insulted a defenseless man .
“ What is the matter , Barrois ? ” said Valentine .

Read and answer , or I will blow out your brains ! ” The sergeant saw that D ’ Artagnan was in earnest .
D ’ Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet .

Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew , as if with regret .
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance , not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier , but also of the duties of a man ; and he thus gained the name of “ the stoic. ” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it , and did not even know what it meant .
Wait ! ” He unfolded the paper , presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it .
“ What ’ s the matter ? ” asked Planchet .
It is almost dinner-time , and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother , my too-devoted maid , and my troublesome brother , who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery , which I am in a fair way never to get done .
I neither know nor care .
The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be .
Then you were about to tell me all—the isolation of your life , the griefs of your heart .
Adieu , my dear Gérard , and at your next journey alight at my door. ” Noirtier left the room when he had finished , with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation .

An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham , named Montague , was taken , and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire , Spain , England , and Lorraine .
Scarcely had D ’ Artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca , which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night .
He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him , although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation , in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks , was very disagreeable to him .
Before the door the traces were yet more apparent ; these horsemen , whoever they might be , had halted there .
His best known work is “ The Three Graces , ” now in the Louvre .
He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence .
The pretty Mme .
Can I not , like Pasta , Malibran , Grisi , acquire for myself what you would never have given me , whatever might have been your fortune , a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum , for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself ; and which , instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs , with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality , will be accompanied with acclamations , with bravos , and with flowers ?
I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you ? ” D ’ Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said , “ I ask alms of no man. ” “ Oh , that ’ s very well , young man , ” continued M. de Tréville , “ that ’ s all very well .
Planchet ! ” “ Planchet , ” added Grimaud ; “ Planchet , with a gorget , indeed ! ” “ Ah , gentlemen ! ” cried Planchet , “ so you are back again in Paris .
It was dark and silent as the tomb .
“ Maximilian has just returned , has he not , madame ? ” asked the count .
“ What do you want with me ? ” said she .

“ Do you think , then , that any harm can have happened to him ? ” asked Aramis .
“ You remind me , ” said the priest , “ that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond. ” “ Said to bear the name ! ” repeated Caderousse , becoming excited and eager .

“ _Pardieu ! _ ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself , to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted , “ _pardieu_ , it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend ’ s house .
Yes , here it is. ” “ Who is this Athos ? ” “ One of my friends. ” “ But if he should be at home and see me ? ” “ He is not at home , and I will carry away the key , after having placed you in his apartment. ” “ But if he should return ? ” “ Oh , he won ’ t return ; and if he should , he will be told that I have brought a woman with me , and that woman is in his apartment. ” “ But that will compromise me sadly , you know. ” “ Of what consequence ?
I also intend from this time to work on my own account .

1.E.7 .
“ How much ? ” asked Danglars .
D ’ Artagnan frowned at him .
30065m “ But I remember it perfectly , ” interposed the darling Edward .
“ And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent , ” said Aramis .
It was as a prey to this hallucination that D ’ Artagnan traveled , at whatever pace his horse pleased , the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from Crèvecœur , without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road .
“ You put back the boards , sweep the floor , go out at the door , and run as I told you. ” “ Oh , monsieur !
“ Diplomat or not , I don ’ t know ; I only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission , which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction , that had I been king , I should have instantly created him knight of all my orders , even had I been able to offer him the Golden Fleece and the Garter. ” “ Well , since we are not to sit down to table , ” said Debray , “ take a glass of sherry , and tell us all about it. ” “ You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa. ” “ It is a road your ancestors have traced for you , ” said Albert gallantly .

ESCAPE As Lord de Winter had thought , Milady ’ s wound was not dangerous .
You must return to the Rue des Fossoyeurs ; I will accompany you. ” “ But however near it may be , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ I can not go thither in this guise. ” “ That ’ s true , ” said Athos , and he rang the bell .
Noirtier , paler than even the young girl , more eager than Villefort for the decision , was watching also intently and affectionately .
Anyone else would have hastened to receive him ; but Villefort was a man of ability , and he knew this would be a sign of weakness .
D ’ Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle .
“ ANNE ” It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men ; but Aramis , after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos , begged his friends not to revert to the subject again , declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it , he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs .
“ But , my good gentleman , ” resumed the old man , upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done , “ do not take on so ; they did not kill her , and that ’ s a comfort. ” “ Can you guess , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ who was the man who headed this infernal expedition ? ” “ I don ’ t know him. ” “ But as you spoke to him you must have seen him. ” “ Oh , it ’ s a description you want ? ” “ Exactly so. ” “ A tall , dark man , with black mustaches , dark eyes , and the air of a gentleman. ” “ That ’ s the man ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ again he , forever he !
The Duc de Beaufort .

Will your eminence please read and examine ? ” “ I am acquainted with it. ” “ Sign it , then. ” “ Reflect , gentlemen , that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence. ” “ Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given. ” “ Suppose I refuse ? ” “ Then , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal. ” “ Would you dare to touch a cardinal ? ” “ You have dared , my lord , to imprison her majesty ’ s musketeers. ” “ The queen will revenge me , gentlemen. ” “ I do not think so , although inclination might lead her to do so , but we shall take your eminence to Paris , and the Parisians will defend us. ” “ How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain , ” said Aramis .
M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer—a galley-slave escaped—a convict ! ” An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugénie .
“ You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind ? ” “ Oh , my dear count , ” exclaimed Danglars , “ I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you. ” “ No , you merely wished to be convinced , nothing more ; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding , and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest , we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year , suppose we say six millions to—— ” “ Six millions ! ” gasped Danglars— “ so be it. ” “ Then , if I should require more , ” continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner , “ why , of course , I should draw upon you ; but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year , and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned .
Laporte , give the light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin. ” The queen touched with her lips the white , smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette .
Occasionally he shuddered ; he thought of the moment when , from the top of that wall , he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine , pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand .

He laid every action of his life before the Almighty , proposed tasks to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God : “ Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. ” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers , Dantès remained a prisoner .

The good abbess had naturally consented to her request ; and as a commencement , they were to sup together .
“ Come this way , gentlemen ; come , M. Villefort , for a declaration to be available , should be made before the competent authorities. ” He then took Villefort ’ s arm , and , at the same time , holding that of Madame Danglars under his own , he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree , where the shade was thickest .
“ Friends ! ” said Athos , “ do you regret you have not shed our blood ? ” “ No , ” replied D ’ Artagnan ; “ I regret to see that we , hitherto united , are opposed to each other .
Do you think it will be long before he comes in ? ” “ No , I think not , for he ordered his breakfast at ten o ’ clock. ” “ Well , I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées , and at ten o ’ clock I will return here ; meanwhile , if the count should come in , will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me ? ” “ You may depend on my doing so , sir , ” said Baptistin .
“ It is an old man ’ s caprice ! ” “ And is there no means of making him revoke his decision ? ” “ Yes , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will , which is now in prejudice of Valentine , to be altered in her favor. ” The count , who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables , appeared to pay no attention to the conversation , and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward , who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird ’ s water-glass .
Cucumetto had been there , however , by accident , as he said , and had carried the maiden off .
Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway , so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person .
The host was alone , seated before his desk , one of the drawers of which was partly open .
A merry morning to you , Sunshine .
‘ Adieu , my lord , ’ murmured my mother , determining quietly to await the approach of death .
I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès. ” “ Nay , nay ! ” cried Caderousse , smiling , “ you have not attained that honor yet .
“ But methinks I need wine ! ” and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left , put it to his mouth , and emptied it at a single draught , as he would have emptied an ordinary glass .
have we ceased to be men ? ” “ No , ” said Aramis , “ but that fellow is a fiend ; and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew. ” De Winter only replied by a groan .
how I have suffered ! ” said Milady , in that harmonious voice which , like that of the ancient enchantresses , charmed all whom she wished to destroy .
Vampa measured the distance ; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him , and there was not a chance of overtaking him .
I love and esteem you , because honest folks are so rare .
The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed ; only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen .
I thank you , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ You are more impetuous than you were , ” returned D ’ Artagnan .
“ Pray , are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury ? ” “ Do then as I did , my lord .
One of them was made of Debray , Château-Renaud , and Beauchamp .
How were you to blame in that affair ? ” “ Listen—when one bears an irreproachable name , as I do , one is rather sensitive. ” “ Everybody pities you , sir ; and , above all , Mademoiselle Danglars ! ” “ Poor Eugénie ! ” said Danglars ; “ do you know she is going to embrace a religious life ? ” “ No. ” “ Alas , it is unhappily but too true .
plague on ’ t , I will guard the king and Porthos shall guard the cardinal. ” This arrangement pleased every one .
“ Speak , sir , and pray begin at the beginning ; I like order in everything. ” “ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ I will render a faithful report to your majesty , but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language. ” A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium , assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor , and he went on : “ Sire , I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible , to inform your majesty that I have discovered , in the exercise of my duties , not a commonplace and insignificant plot , such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army , but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty ’ s throne .
See , here it is. ” The woman gazed at it a moment , and then said , in a gloomy voice , “ Suppose it ’ s false ? ” Caderousse started and turned pale .
“ _My dear cousin_. ” “ Ah , ah ! ” said Athos .
“ Friend , ” said he , “ for Athos this is too much ; for the Comte de la Fère it is too little .
“ I have—doubtless I am dreaming ; tell me , sir , ” he said to the sergeant , “ do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out ? ” “ Only by their passports ; they are three Frondists , who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longueville. ” “ ’ Tis strange , ” said Aramis , almost involuntarily ; “ I fancied that I recognized Mazarin himself. ” The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter .
“ For two reasons. ” “ What ones ? ” “ The first is that my mistress will never love you. ” “ How do you know that ? ” “ You have cut her to the heart. ” “ I ?
You first , Mousqueton , ” and he stopped his friends , directing the valets to go first , in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat .
Your Eminence is right .
Branded in the eyes of the world you invoke , try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad ! ’ “ Then , addressing the man who accompanied him , ‘ Executioner , ’ said he , ‘ do your duty. ’ ” “ Oh , his name , his name ! ” cried Felton .
But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible , and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach .
“ Your address at Paris ? ” “ Hôtel of the Guards , company of Dessessart. ” “ Enough , ” replied the questioner .

He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was , and that he would be obedient to her orders .
“ Open ; it is I. ” But notwithstanding this request , notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered , the door remained closed .
Come now , recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de Gassion. ” “ But a humpbacked general !
A hundred louis ?
You have no idea what a false look you have , particularly when you are afraid .
Go on Aramis , go on. ” “ All at once , a tall , dark gentleman—just like yours , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ The same , perhaps , ” said he .
Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat , and presenting myself at the great gate , introduce myself .
The abbé took it , and in return gave Caderousse the diamond .
With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea , while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud .
The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father ’ s death .
I am not a banker , like M. Danglars , but I am quite as incredulous as he is. ” “ I am going to give you a proof , ” replied the count , and he rang the bell .
D ’ Artagnan , then , remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility , till he came to this unlucky city of Meung .

Before the entrance of the magistrates , and indeed frequently afterwards , a court of justice , on days when some especial trial is to take place , resembles a drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats ; or , if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers , communicate by signs .

“ I propose to defend no one but myself , and I shall defend myself vigorously , I give you warning. ” “ Very well , ” said the voice ; “ go away from here and leave the place to us. ” “ Go away from here ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , whose purposes were in conflict with that order , “ that is not so easy , since I am on the point of falling , and my horse , too , through fatigue ; unless , indeed , you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood. ” “ Rascal ! ” “ Eh !
We don ’ t know the locality , and shall never find the wall .
“ Let my lord at two o ’ clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts. ” “ And then ? ” “ Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again. ” “ I understand , ” said the duke .
At the same time he felt the duke ’ s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws ; but instead either of calling out or defending himself , he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone : “ Hush ! ” smiling as he uttered the word .
“ I ’ faith ! ” said D ’ Artagnan to Raoul , “ you were just in time to stay my hand .

“ Maillard , ” began the curate , “ this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little. ” “ With me ! ” said the mendicant ; “ it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water. ” There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor .
I am just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung , twenty-two years ago , you know ; alas ! ” and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh .
“ The wise man , my child , has said , ‘ It is good to think of death. ’ ” “ Well , if you die , ” said she , “ bequeath your fortune to others , for if you die I shall require nothing ; ” and , taking the paper , she tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the middle of the room .
Pressing his lips close to the planks , he exclaimed : “ Don ’ t be alarmed , Valentine—it is I ! ” Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate , saying , as she did so : “ And why do you come so late today ?
He was dressed with all the English peculiarity , namely , in a blue coat , with gilt buttons and high collar , in the fashion of 1811 , a white kerseymere waistcoat , and nankeen pantaloons , three inches too short , but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee .
He then thought , with a touch of vexation , that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him .
But I lay aside that pride before God , who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am. ” “ Then , count , I admire you , ” said Villefort , who , for the first time in this strange conversation , used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage , whom , until now , he had only called monsieur .
“ Oh , nothing but a scratch , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici .
“ You are pale and agitated. ” “ Sir , ” replied the young man , “ it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor. ” “ To Mademoiselle de la Valliere ? ” asked Athos , quickly .
“ Forgive , Edmond , forgive for my sake , who love you still ! ” The dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother .

Dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes , when the patron , who had great confidence in him , and was very desirous of retaining him in his service , took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del ’ Oglio , where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade .
as to that , ” said Aramis , “ we are witnesses .
Besides , he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother , and that she will , in all probability , inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran , her mother ’ s parents , who both love her tenderly. ” “ And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ besides , they are to come to Paris in about a month , and Valentine , after the affront she has received , need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M. Noirtier. ” The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition .
Those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm ?
“ Whether success rendered us imprudent , or whether we were betrayed , I know not ; but one evening , about five o ’ clock , our little cabin-boy came breathlessly , to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our direction .
“ I will give it to none but the king , monsieur , ” said Anne .
“ Because , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest. ” “ And you have been here since—— ” “ About a quarter of an hour , ” said D ’ Artagnan , motioning to Porthos not to contradict him .
“ Everything , ” said he to Raoul , “ shall be done as you desire ; but you will not stop to have your wound dressed ? ” “ Oh , my wound—mine— ’ tis nothing , ” replied the viscount ; “ it will be time to think about it when we next halt ; only have the goodness , should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant , to tell him , in fact , that you have seen me , but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at Mazingarbe and to stop at Cambrin .
Four of the guards , who were constantly near the prisoner , assisted in picking up the tennis balls .
“ Drink this , and then take nothing more tonight. ” Valentine stretched out her hand , but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear .

There he found everything arranged in due order , —the accusation , examination , Morrel ’ s petition , M. de Villefort ’ s marginal notes .
Albert , with his eyes closed , was standing grasping the window-curtains .
Athos did not even turn his head .

He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay , and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré .

“ Good heavens ! ” said Aramis to Athos , “ does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante-chamber ? ” “ My dear friend , we must take people as we find them .
Emmanuel , go with them , and see that my orders are executed. ” “ At least , we shall see each other again , M. Morrel ? ” asked Penelon .
She was very beautiful , but her usual pallor had increased ; her eyes were more brilliant than ever , and her hands , which were generally white like mother-of-pearl , now more resembled wax , to which time was adding a yellowish hue .
The matter had been named to him by D ’ Artagnan , who in the first place pointed out the money to him , then the glory , and then the danger .
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment .
“ Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars ?
From that day D ’ Artagnan felt lonely and powerless , without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from Heaven .

They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur d ’ Arminges .
“ Here I am , your excellency , ” said Peppino , with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to him .
“ I shall soon return , ” said the banker to Monte Cristo ; “ wait for me .
Were you a party man ?
The hostess , as she entered , saw D ’ Artagnan and uttered a little cry , whereupon D ’ Artagnan , judging that he had been recognized , rose , ran to her and embraced her tenderly .
“ Hush ! ” said Athos .
“ I was passing close to the door of the captain ’ s cabin , which was half open , and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès. ” “ He did not speak to me of it , ” replied the shipowner ; “ but if there be any letter he will give it to me. ” Danglars reflected for a moment .
“ It is my cousin ! ” cried the procurator ’ s wife .

“ Let me think a moment .
Try , therefore , either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here .

This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor , he stopped , laid down his pickaxe , seized his gun , mounted to the summit of the highest rock , and from thence gazed round in every direction .
Indeed , this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men ; one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children. ” “ My dear Athos , I admire you , but nevertheless we were in the wrong , after all. ” “ How , in the wrong ? ” said Athos .
As for patience , I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before , and every night renewing the task of the day .
“ My dear Monsieur Louvieres , ” said the coadjutor , “ believe me , I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you. ” “ Is that true , and do you speak seriously ? ” asked Louvieres .
Milady wished to please the abbess .
Orders had just been given to the royal guards and the Swiss guards , not only to stand firm , but to send out patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin , where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous , when the mayor of Paris was announced at the Palais Royal .
Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path , he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him .

He caused me to be arrested , had me conducted hither , and placed me under your guard .
I will say—— ” “ Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself ? ” said Bertuccio , in so calm a tone , and with so steadfast a look , that Andrea was moved to the very soul .
“ He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it , ” whispered Caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off Fernand , to Danglars .
His head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , Athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at Grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately .
Milady seized the occasion .
“ No ; I searched the whole thicket .
And she went out , but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel .
“ You are , indeed , the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw ! ” “ Dear child ! ” said Mercédès , endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye .

He then saw the great aqueducts , those stone phantoms which he had before remarked , only then they were on the right hand , now they were on the left .
I suppose you mean— ” continued D ’ Artagnan .
Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman , who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussel ’ s door .
Athos saw the movement ; he made a step toward the muskets , upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes , like men ill-disposed to allow themselves to be taken .
Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about .
“ Well , my lord , I sew up the paper in the ball and you , in your game of tennis , will send the ball into the ditch. ” “ But will it not be lost ? ” “ Oh no ; there will be some one at hand to pick it up. ” “ A gardener ? ” Grimaud nodded .
The _mêlée_ became general , but strength was on the side of the Musketeers .

“ And the next day , Bernajoux .
“ I will not abandon Buckingham thus .
D ’ Artagnan reassured her as well as he could , and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Milady .
He hastened to the side-door with Ali , entered hurriedly , and by the servants ’ staircase , of which he had the key , gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain , without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he supposed empty , contained its chief occupant .
“ To the judge—to the judge , madame ! ” It was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman , the anguish of her look , the trembling of her whole frame .
“ And I again repeat , you shall not commit suicide. ” “ Prevent me , then ! ” replied Morrel , with another struggle , which , like the first , failed in releasing him from the count ’ s iron grasp .
The question is this : Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic. ” “ Your thesis !
Since his majesty still lives , since the honor of the throne is safe , everything else is a matter of indifference to me. ” Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart .
Ah !
No , be not anxious ; he is traveling on business and will return ere long .
This idea imparted new energy , and in three days he had succeeded , with the utmost precaution , in removing the cement , and exposing the stone-work .
_pardieu ! _ mute as a carp. ” “ Well , I think—— ” Andrea stopped and looked around .
DREAM OF VENGEANCE That evening Milady gave orders that when M. d ’ Artagnan came as usual , he should be immediately admitted ; but he did not come .
“ Well , my lord , ” said La Ramee , with his rude laugh , “ you still set yourself against this poor fellow ? ” “ So !
He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie ; there the aspect changed ; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop ; their doors seemed closed like their shutters , but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men , who seemed fearful of showing what they carried , to enter , closing immediately .
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated .
Now , I don ’ t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the Indies .
The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side , saw the young peasants , and galloping up , began to question them .
She found Milady with a smiling countenance .
“ Is it your decision , Athos ? ” resumed the Gascon .
He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours .
He laughs best who laughs last .
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks , or even tailors .
“ What can he be looking for ? ” thought Edmond .
“ Now , ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself , noticing that silent play of countenance , “ I am sure of it. ” “ I hope the accident has been of no consequence ? ” “ They don ’ t yet know , sir , on account of the swelling ; but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured. ” At this moment a little boy , half peasant , half foot-boy , came to announce supper .
“ Help !
“ Certainly , ” continued Danglars , “ the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned .
And I , who have answered for him to the queen—I , who have promised my poor mistress—ah , my God , my God !
It is said , sympathy travels rapidly , and when at Tréport , I felt the electric shock ; you have either been working for me or thinking of me. ” “ Possibly , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I have indeed thought of you , but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted , indeed , without my knowledge. ” 30277m “ Indeed !
That depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me. ” “ Then today , madame— ” “ Oh , today , I am no further than gratitude. ” “ Ah !
D ’ Artagnan had not failed in his career , but circumstances had been adverse to him .
“ And why ? ” “ Your excellency will know when you have read the letter. ” “ Shall I find you here , then ? ” “ Certainly. ” Franz entered the hotel .

Therefore , if you part with M. Baptistin , give me the refusal of him. ” “ By all means. ” “ That is not all ; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese , Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti ; and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son , find him a wife very rich , very noble on her mother ’ s side at least , and a baroness in right of her father , I will help you in the search. ” “ Ah , ha ; you will do as much as that , will you ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , really , nothing is certain in this world. ” “ Oh , count , what a service you might render me !
“ Don ’ t let us disarrange your eminence .
You can not be mistaken ; there is but one. ” “ Afterward ? ” “ You will ask for the host , and will repeat to him the word ‘ Forward ! ’ ” “ Which means ? ” “ In French , _En avant_ .

Here is an order for two hundred pistoles ; call upon my treasurer and get the money .
The horses will have a long night ’ s rest , and at five o ’ clock to-morrow morning we can be again on the road. ” Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master , grumbling .
keep quiet while my master is being arrested !
In short , what shall I say to you , Felton ? ” continued Milady , in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime .
Villefort , who did not choose to reveal the whole secret , lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure , had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness .
Besides , he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition , much keenness of wit , and as to suitability , M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic—that is his word. ” “ And then , ” said Eugénie , while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villefort ’ s album , “ add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man. ” “ And , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ I need not ask you if you share that fancy. ” “ I ? ” replied Eugénie with her usual candor .
An hour of terror elapsed , for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back .
The prisoners then approached and formed a circle .
Louis XVIII .
Milady put her charming blond head out at the window , and gave her orders to her maid .
“ All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , is doubtless true , ” said the queen , “ but I have confidence in you alone .
“ Alack !
Certainly I see him. ” “ Then I did not kill him ? ” “ Really , I think you are going mad , good Bertuccio , ” said the count .

Albert rubbed his eyes , ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking-room on the ground floor , dressed himself quickly , and went down .

When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter , it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night .
The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy ; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness .
perhaps your love will make me forget all that I do not wish to remember. ” “ What do you mean , my lord ? ” “ I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience ; I have but you in the world , Haydée ; through you I again take hold on life , through you I shall suffer , through you rejoice. ” “ Do you hear him , Valentine ? ” exclaimed Haydée ; “ he says that through me he will suffer—through _me_ , who would yield my life for his. ” The count withdrew for a moment .
Athos replaced his in his belt ; Porthos and Aramis , who held their drawn swords in their hands , returned them to their scabbards .
“ It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood. ” “ There ’ s only one remedy , dear Raoul—that is , to marry her as a compensation. ” remarked D ’ Artagnan .
In fact , Mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met D ’ Artagnan and Aramis , and that D ’ Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the Béarnese pony upon which he had come to Paris , and which he had sold for three crowns .
In the midst of this chamber were four stones , which had formerly served as an altar , as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them .
“ Your Eminence may be certain of that. ” The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice , “ Rochefort ! ” The chevalier , who no doubt was near the door , entered immediately .
Now , madame , ” said Debray , delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker , “ there are still 80,000 francs , the interest of this money , in my hands. ” “ But , ” said the baroness , “ I thought you never put the money out to interest. ” “ Excuse me , madame , ” said Debray coldly , “ I had your permission to do so , and I have made use of it .
“ Let him follow me ; I will take him to his cell. ” “ Go ! ” said the gendarmes , thrusting Dantès forward .
Now , as a half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man , the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined .
“ Oh !
“ Patrick , ” said Groslow , “ take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn .
No , fifteen thousand are not enough , —I can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs. ” “ No , ” replied Andrea , dryly , “ no , I can not . ” “ I do not think you understand me , ” replied Caderousse , calmly ; “ I said without your laying out a sou. ” “ Do you want me to commit a robbery , to spoil all my good fortune—and yours with mine—and both of us to be dragged down there again ? ” “ It would make very little difference to me , ” said Caderousse , “ if I were retaken , I am a poor creature to live alone , and sometimes pine for my old comrades ; not like you , heartless creature , who would be glad never to see them again. ” Andrea did more than tremble this time , he turned pale .
Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub , but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested .
“ As you please , ” he said ; “ death is always death , —that is forgetfulness , repose , exclusion from life , and therefore from grief. ” He sat down , and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him .

Planchet called his master ’ s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey , and only preceded them by about fifty paces .
Chapter LV .
I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world , and the gentleman , who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor , was made an officer. ” “ Come , ” said Monte Cristo , “ this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded .

Porthos bowed .
“ Oh dear , yes , sir ; the abbé ’ s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonaparte ’ s emissaries , —one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 , a very resolute and very dangerous man. ” “ Indeed ! ” said the Englishman .
“ Monsieur , ” said Morrel , whose uneasiness was increased by this examination , “ you wish to speak to me ? ” “ Yes , monsieur ; you are aware from whom I come ? ” “ The house of Thomson & French ; at least , so my cashier tells me. ” “ He has told you rightly .
Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage .
“ While the rest slept , then , we went away a short distance ; we severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us , and swam away. ” “ And what is become of this Benedetto ? ” “ I don ’ t know. ” “ You ought to know. ” “ No , in truth ; we parted at Hyères. ” And , to give more weight to his protestation , Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé , who remained motionless in his place , as calm as ever , and pursuing his interrogation .

Born in the neighborhood of Arles , she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial ; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue .
It may be judged whether D ’ Artagnan looked or listened with avidity .
Anne of Austria returned to her oratory , furious .
He was then reconducted by the little staircase , instead of passing through the ante-chamber where D ’ Artagnan was waiting .
We will invoke the remembrance of that poor De Winter , for whom he seemed to have a great regard ; we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on ; we will spend with him a guinea each per day ; and I think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed. ” “ You forget , Aramis , one precaution of considerable importance. ” “ What is that ? ” “ The precaution of changing our clothes. ” “ Changing our clothes ! ” exclaimed Porthos .
“ Monsieur , ” replied the count , with a chilling air , “ I am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother , for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all ; and the good fortune which occurred to me , monsieur , might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which , in its discharge , confers an undoubtedly great honor ; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me , —a favor which , however estimable , is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness. ” Villefort , astonished at this reply , which he by no means expected , started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears , and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman .

“ Oh , my mother ! ” exclaimed Albert , so overcome he could scarcely speak ; “ it is not the same with you and me—you can not have made the same resolution I have , for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house , and—and to you. ” “ I also , ” replied Mercédès , “ am going , and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me ; have I deceived myself ? ” “ Mother , ” said Albert with firmness .
“ Five hundred pounds. ” “ And where did you get so much money ? ” said Athos .
Milady had told the truth—her head was confused , for her ill-arranged plans clashed one another like chaos .
All these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of Signor Pastrini ’ s ; the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were also not wanting .
I heard the Chevalier d ’ Herblay say so. ” “ The fool ! ” cried Blaisois , “ I wish I had been in his place. ” “ Thou canst be , ” said Grimaud , writing down his figures .
“ Save the queen ! ” cried Mazarin to the coadjutor .
The minutes passed ; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine .
“ Mother , ” exclaimed Albert , just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs , “ let us reckon our riches , if you please ; I want capital to build my plans upon. ” “ Capital—nothing ! ” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile .
But M. de Tréville knew nothing , except that the last time he had seen the cardinal , the king , and the queen , the cardinal looked very thoughtful , the king uneasy , and the redness of the queen ’ s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful .

For the rest this vengeance was very easy ; for Milady , doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover , had ordered Kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment , and even in the little chamber itself .
The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait , which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands ; had doubled Pomègue , and approached the harbor under topsails , jib , and spanker , but so slowly and sedately that the idlers , with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil , asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board .
“ You will live , my Lord , you will live ! ” repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria , on his knees before the duke ’ s sofa .
1.D .
“ Now is my time to make peace with this gallant man , ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself , having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation ; and with this good feeling drawing near to Aramis , who was departing without paying any attention to him , “ Monsieur , ” said he , “ you will excuse me , I hope. ” “ Ah , monsieur , ” interrupted Aramis , “ permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought. ” “ What , monsieur ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ and do you suppose— ” “ I suppose , monsieur , that you are not a fool , and that you knew very well , although coming from Gascony , that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason .
D ’ Artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect , and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal ’ s letter It was , however , merely a letter of introduction .
Bonacieux remained standing , mute , motionless , and pale as a statue .
Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs , and that would teach her prudence. ” “ I do not understand , ” stammered Lucien .
He shut the bedroom door after him , without adding another word , and returned to his apartments ; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition , she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream .
May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars ? ” 20351m “ I have that honor ; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred .
And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher ? ” “ Yes , monsieur , and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line .
For my part , I declare , D ’ Artagnan , I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom. ” D ’ Artagnan blushed .
They were rapidly leaving the Château d ’ If behind .
Let us manage it better .
In short , at the moment in which she has just obtained from Richelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy , this precious paper is torn from her hands , and it is D ’ Artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy Botany Bay , some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean .
“ Alas !
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her , plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection—a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind , because for the first time she doubts , for the first time she fears .
It is true I fought with tolerable success. ” “ I don ’ t speak of your warlike exploits , monsieur , ” said Mazarin ; “ although they gained you much reputation , they were surpassed by others. ” D ’ Artagnan pretended astonishment .
“ Ah , you will tell all I have said , will you not , reverend sir ? ” “ Yes , and much more. ” “ What more will you say ? ” “ I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house , in the hope the count would kill you .
“ Such songs disturb the mind ; and yet we become accustomed to them , her voice is so beautiful. ” Chapter LIV .
“ Yes , monseigneur , ” said Porthos , “ it is he. ” “ Monsieur Athos , ” said Richelieu , “ receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept .
“ Buckingham , the executioner of this angelic creature ! ” cried Felton .
What is your opinion , gentlemen , and does not M. Mouston ’ s suggestion appear to you full of sense ? ” “ Oh ! ” said Aramis , “ suppose the master is a Puritan ? ” “ So much the better , mordioux ! ” replied D ’ Artagnan ; “ if he is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king , and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens. ” “ But if he should be a cavalier ? ” said Porthos .
Louis XIII .
“ And now what are we to do , and where do you wish me to conduct you ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan .
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party .
“ How , badly ?
No one answered .
“ And yet that woman deserved her fate ; do you not think so ? ” “ On one ’ s death-bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one ’ s own , ” said the executioner ; and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes .
The Rendezvous The first words that Albert uttered to his friend , on the following morning , contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count ; true , the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening ; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged .
“ No , certainly not. ” “ You were sent by some other person ? ” “ Yes. ” “ By the excellent Abbé Busoni ? ” “ Exactly so , ” said the delighted major .
“ In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse , who was discovered in some distant country , and brought back to France , where he made a full confession , refusing to make the fact of his wife ’ s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt .
There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows. ” “ But , then , by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position ? ” “ Both , sir—he has both fortune and position—both. ” “ This must be impossible ! ” “ It would seem so ; but listen , and you will understand .
D ’ Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding ; they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door , leaped upon them , buried their spurs in their sides , and set off at full gallop .
She suited me in every respect , and I would have married her. ” And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars ’ departure before he left the house .
“ Hold my stirrup , Bazin , ” cried Aramis ; and Aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility , but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat .
d ’ Avrigny , ” cried Villefort , “ I can not tell you all I feel at this moment , —terror , grief , madness. ” “ Yes , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , with an imposing calmness , “ but I think it is now time to act .
Five minutes elapsed , during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna ; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage , which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion .
The count had , indeed , just arrived , but he was in his bath , and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted .
I know how clear-sighted your dreams are ; I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt , and I gained 400,000 francs by it , of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you .
“ Where are you come from , sir ?
An overpowering sadness took possession of the young man , his hands relaxed their hold , the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color , and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall .
“ He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock , which hangs behind his uniform , ” said another Musketeer .
Come , M. Debray , you are a connoisseur , I believe , let me have your opinion upon them. ” As Debray walked towards the window , Danglars approached his wife .
One ball struck the head of the already-wounded guard , and the other flattened itself against a rock , after having passed within two inches of D ’ Artagnan .
Athos sighed deeply .
No , Emmanuel , I am but a man , and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious. ” And pressing his lips on the hand of Julie , who rushed into his arms , he extended his other hand to Emmanuel ; then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness , he made a sign to Maximilian , who followed him passively , with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had so stunned him .
The queen will never banish me , and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me ; if I fly , she will fly ; and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen .
A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document ; the count could only stare , and his gaze , fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée , seemed one of fire and blood .
All these trees , great or small , were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows , one of the three curses of Provence , the others being the Durance and the Parliament .
“ Ah , it is M. de Morcerf , ” said Monte Cristo quietly ; “ I thought I had not heard aright. ” “ Yes , it is I , ” said the count , whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely .
At this moment a man entered , without even knocking at the door .
“ Will , ” said the notary ; “ it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of making his will. ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” motioned the invalid .
“ Eh , eh , eh ! ” stammered Caderousse .
“ Monsieur le comte , monsieur le chevalier , if ever I am king—— ” “ Sire , you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to , therefore gratitude is on our side .
“ Help me , gentlemen , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ we must break in this door. ” “ It is the devil in person ! ” said Aramis , hastening forward .
Passing alongside one of them , D ’ Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung—the same whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady , and whom D ’ Artagnan had thought so handsome ; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind , his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her .
After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of God. ” “ But let me see , how was it done ?
I have come , therefore , to discharge this duty , and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude. ” And as he said this , the “ eye severe ” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance .
Chapter XXXVI .
He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came , and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality .
You see , Felton , the drama has gone through all the phases I named ; but be easy , no blood will flow. ” Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage .
“ You know , ” said the abbé , “ that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada , the last of the princes of that name .
Ghosts Chapter 63 .
“ Sir , ” suddenly exclaimed the countess , after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence , “ is it true that you have seen so much , travelled so far , and suffered so deeply ? ” “ I have suffered deeply , madame , ” answered Monte Cristo .
“ Here I am , ” smiled Porthos , with his sublime composure .
I hold this serpent in my hands .
“ But it is probable , ” said the light-horseman , “ that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion. ” “ Yes , that ’ s probable , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ I should think so , but not without difficulty .
Besides , nobody came thither but the three Musketeers ; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries , but had discovered nothing .
if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits , when we were at Crevecoeur ; I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron .
“ Is that what you wish for ? ” said Barrois .
All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of D ’ Artagnan , who looked at him with more attention than he had done before .
“ Meanwhile , the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him ; but the first lines aroused his attention ; he read them again and again , and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf , ‘ Count , ’ said he , ‘ you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care ? ’ — ‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied Morcerf ; ‘ but in that , like all the rest , misfortune pursued me .
Nonsense !
“ Well , beautiful lady , very well , ” said he ; “ but , _pardieu_ , if you don ’ t calm yourself , I will design a second _fleur-de-lis_ upon one of those pretty cheeks ! ” “ Scoundrel , infamous scoundrel ! ” howled Milady .
1.F.5 .
Then he bowed a second time and retired .
At this moment Raoul awoke , without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude ; his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress , for his glance , in return , had all the tenderness of love .
For example , supposing it were the daughter of a banker , he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law of his son ; then again , if he disliked his choice , the major takes the key , double-locks his coffer , and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family , by shuffling cards or rattling the dice. ” “ Ah , that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess ; he will want a crown , an El Dorado , and Potosí. ” “ No ; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry into plain families ; like Jupiter , they like to cross the race .
Our young men had been waiting about half an hour , amid a crowd of courtiers , when all the doors were thrown open , and his Majesty was announced .
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : “ Go on , I know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , God and I will judge. ” “ Oh , father , ” continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , “ it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river , that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature—the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave—united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , ‘ Place for the justice of God ! ’ ” “ Delirium ! ” murmured the monk , shaking his head .
“ I beg a thousand pardons , ” said the count , “ there is nothing the matter , but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow .
“ I am going wherever it may please the count to take me , ” said Morrel , with a smile full of grief ; “ I am under his orders for the next month. ” “ Oh , heavens , how strangely he expresses himself , count ! ” said Julie .
“ Less quickly than the women , it seems to me , ” replied Porthos ; “ for I , madame , I may say I was your victim , when wounded , dying , I was abandoned by the surgeons .
He will inform against you .
“ You will begin , therefore , by taking me first out of Paris , will you not , my dear M. d ’ Artagnan ? ” “ A difficult commission , my lord , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , resuming his serious manner .
“ This miserable strain confines me to my bed ; but Mousqueton forages , and brings in provisions .
Father and Son We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred , and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade , and follow Dantès , who , after having traversed La Canebière , took the Rue de Noailles , and entering a small house , on the left of the Allées de Meilhan , rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase , holding the baluster with one hand , while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart , and paused before a half-open door , from which he could see the whole of a small room .
All falsehood is a mask ; and however well made the mask may be , with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face .
This could not , then , be a military ambuscade , as the ball was not of the regular caliber .
A terrible idea , however , rushed into her mind .
“ Yes , ” said he .
“ Soho ! ” cried Athos .
Now you have done , Grimaud , take our brigadier ’ s half-pike , tie a napkin to it , and plant it on top of our bastion , that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king. ” Grimaud obeyed without replying .
“ Peppino , ” said the brigand chief , “ give me the torch. ” “ What are you going to do ? ” inquired the count .
But I swear to you , before God who hears us , that if you betray me , and my enemies pardon me , I will kill myself , while accusing you of my death. ” “ And I—I swear to you before God , madame , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me , I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone. ” Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samaritaine .
I can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars. ” 30107m “ Ah , ” said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , “ that may be easily explained ; the Comtesse de Morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough. ” “ I do not know if that is her reason , ” said Albert , “ but one thing I do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable .
“ Well , then , will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome ? ” “ With pleasure. ” There was a cry of “ Shut up ! ” from the audience .
He could already see the intendant ’ s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief .
One of the three will certainly be at home , perhaps all three .
Two royal pages were playing with him .
“ I am a dead man , ” he said , and fell from his horse to the ground .
“ Because I am too young to die ! ” “ The woman you poisoned at Béthune was still younger than you , madame , and yet she is dead , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
I drew near , and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag .
“ In an hour ? ” inquired Danglars , turning pale .
Do you know about that institution ? ” “ I have heard of it. ” “ It is a magnificent charity. ” Having said this , the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies .
Uneasiness took possession of the tender , constant heart of Athos , and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis .
“ _Parbleu ! _ ” said Athos .
Now , Planchet has an excellent memory ; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance , he will allow himself to be beaten to death .
Take my advice , renounce this woman .
Oh , no ! ” said he , “ but help me to die , if you can. ” “ Are you a priest ? ” asked Raoul .
I wish them to be promulgated immediately. ” “ But , my Lord , if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure , what shall I reply ? ” “ That such is my pleasure , and that I answer for my will to no man. ” “ Will that be the answer , ” replied the secretary , smiling , “ which he must transmit to his Majesty if , by chance , his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain ? ” “ You are right , Mr. Jackson , ” replied Buckingham .
From seven o ’ clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates , and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged .
My lord has forgotten the supper. ” “ No , but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud. ” “ My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present. ” “ Go on , then ; have it your own way. ” “ Come here , my lad , ” said La Ramee , “ and hear what I have to say. ” Grimaud approached , with a very sullen expression on his face .
This would have been a method of reckoning time , had not Dantès long ceased to do so .
“ I tell you that with that wretched sum , ” continued Andrea , “ I could obtain a coat , and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily expecting. ” “ Of course—of course , ” said the prisoners ; — “ anyone can see he ’ s a gentleman ! ” “ Well , then , lend him the twenty francs , ” said the keeper , leaning on the other shoulder ; “ surely you will not refuse a comrade ! ” 50151m “ I am no comrade of these people , ” said the young man , proudly , “ you have no right to insult me thus. ” The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs , and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner , raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper .
Of this , however , be assured , that should any favorable opportunity present itself , I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present. ” “ For shame , M. de Villefort ! ” said Renée , becoming quite pale ; “ don ’ t you see how you are frightening us ? —and yet you laugh. ” “ What would you have ?
Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path ? ” “ Never , ” answered De Guiche .
There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach .
Something was at work on the other side of the wall ; the prisoner had discovered the danger , and had substituted a lever for a chisel .
“ On the contrary , gentlemen , we would assist you if it were necessary. ” “ What does he say ? ” grumbled Porthos .
Chapter XXIX .
She howled as the hurricane howled ; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature , which also seemed to groan with despair .
“ Do you require my services now ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny .
He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune. ” “ By your misfortune ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored ? ” “ He gave me one great proof of his sympathy , at any rate. ” “ And that ? ” “ He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me. ” “ What ?
The vessel was quite ready to sail , and the captain was waiting on the wharf .
Morrel was leaning against one of these , mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves .
Egad !
The Carnival was over .
Planchet , prouder than ever of his new duties , deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place Royale with two hundred men , forming the rear of the army of Paris , and to march on Charenton when necessary .
“ My letter is private and confidential , and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels .
The husband had presided at the abduction of his wife .
Sire , we have all been blind , and the minister of police has shared the general blindness , that is all. ” “ But—— ” said Villefort , and then suddenly checking himself , he was silent ; then he continued , “ Your pardon , sire , ” he said , bowing , “ my zeal carried me away .
I must return to the minister ’ s .
I am for those who save the state , ” said Bonacieux , emphatically .
You sustained me powerfully , sir , and I protest to you that to-day I feel very lonely .
“ Halloo ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ has something fresh happened ? ” “ Eh , sir ! ” replied the sergeant , “ their vehicle has broken down a second time ; it really must be doomed. ” “ They are bad managers , ” said D ’ Artagnan , shrugging his shoulders .
“ The day after that , you received a visit from Cavois , ” resumed the cardinal .
D ’ Artagnan jumped into the saddle , then the old companions in arms again shook hands .
They saw , or rather continued to see , the image of what they had witnessed ; but little by little the general vertigo seized them , and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion .
Chapter 75 .
“ Ah ! ” cried the duke , “ will you not accept any money from me ? ” “ I wish my lord would make me one promise. ” “ What !
But D ’ Artagnan , whose ideas had taken quite another course , forgot himself like a fool , and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts .
“ But that is not all , madame .
“ With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction ! ” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated .
And you go— ” “ In an hour—time to eat a morsel , during which I shall send for a post horse. ” “ Capital !
‘ The third of my friends , although my rival , was much attached to me , —his name was Fernand ; that of my betrothed was ’ —Stay , stay , ” continued the abbé , “ I have forgotten what he called her. ” “ Mercédès , ” said Caderousse eagerly .
There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point. ” “ _Cedant arma togæ_ , ” said Villefort with a bow .
“ Listen , ” said the young man to the sentinel .
I would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the Bastile. ” He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived .
What would the patron think ?
As to the key , it had disappeared .
True , the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices ; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance .
“ In the first place , count , this youth is our prisoner ; you seem to forget that .
And yet , since the amusement seemed to me rather tame , I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors , and , in order to see to advantage , that we should mount the bronze horse .
But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed : “ Oh , grandpapa , I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me ; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed. ” “ Ah , yes , most assuredly , ” said the eyes of the paralytic , for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake .
The count felt his heart beat more rapidly .
M. Coquenard was served first , then Porthos .
What say you ? ” “ I can not believe such was the case .
The groom heard him with humility , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the reins to Andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished boot lightly on the step .
Coquenard , whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table .
It may be observed that at the very moment when , thanks to the ray of the sun , he perceived the gun barrel , he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him .
They were in earnest conversation .
At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow , a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart-strings .
“ Very well ; if ever you meet him again , wherever it may be , whether on the high road or in the street or in a church , anywhere that he or you may be , put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity , without mercy , as you would crush a viper or a scorpion !
Alas , her emotions were wholly personal : she was thinking only of Villefort ’ s departure .
“ Well ? ” asked the cardinal , on seeing La Houdinière return .
Each man had stabbed him separately , and , intoxicated by their crime , though still pale with fear , they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire , after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold .
He went the first time to save the honor of a great queen ; the second , to avert the death of a great king. ” “ Sir , ” said Anne to Mazarin , with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression , “ see if we can do something for these gentlemen. ” “ I wish to do , madame , all that your majesty pleases. ” “ Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests ; that is your name , is it not , sir ? ” “ I have another name , madame—I am called Athos. ” “ Madame , ” said Mazarin , with a smile , “ you may rest easy ; your wishes shall be fulfilled. ” “ You hear , sir ? ” said the queen .
Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart !
“ Isn ’ t this fox a genius , Athos ? ” asked the Gascon .
I took a week to go , another to return , four days of quarantine , and forty-eight hours to stay there ; that makes three weeks .
“ Well ! ” said Porthos and Aramis together , as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing , “ well , he signed the paper she required ! ” “ I know it , ” said Athos , coolly , “ since here it is. ” And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters , except to give the watchword to the sentinels .
When he drew near to the bedroom door , Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols ; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings .
We will escape , and if we can not escape we will talk ; you of those whom you love , and I of those whom I love .
The wall was built of rough stones , among which , to give strength to the structure , blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded .
Morcerf and Château-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission .
If De Wardes had at that moment been under his hand , he would have killed him .
He was approached to be examined , and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat , that he was an officer of the musketeers , he was surrounded , with the intention of making him cry , “ Down with Mazarin ! ” The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first ; but when he discovered what it meant , he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied .
They found him up , less pale than when D ’ Artagnan left him after his first visit , and seated at a table on which , though he was alone , was spread enough for four persons .
One of its chiefs , who understood Provençal , begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory , where , like the sailors of old , they had run their boats ashore .
“ He was , then , a more unhappy son than you , Morrel , for he could not even find his father ’ s grave. ” “ But then he had the woman he loved still remaining ? ” “ You are deceived , Morrel , that woman—— ” “ She was dead ? ” “ Worse than that , she was faithless , and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed .
Ough !
“ P.S.—I now believe in Italian _banditti_. ” Below these lines were written , in a strange hand , the following in Italian : “ _Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il Conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere_ .
No , indeed ; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected .
“ We shall go out all the same. ” “ Do you know , my dear fellow , why master pastrycooks never work with their hands ? ” “ No , ” said Porthos , “ but I should be glad to be informed. ” “ It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked. ” “ What then ? ” “ Why , then they would be laughed at , and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at. ” “ And what have master pastrycooks to do with us ? ” “ We ought , in our adventures , never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us .
Then he had been seized upon by Danglars , who , with a rapid glance at the stiff-necked old major and his modest son , and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count , made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir .
Andrea had fled .
If once discovered , he knew he would be lost , for the roof afforded no chance of escape ; he therefore resolved to descend , not through the same chimney by which he had come up , but by a similar one conducting to another room .
And that mysterious staircase , the passage through which , not to disturb their sleep , the doctor and nurse pass , or even the father carrying the sleeping child ? ” Here Madame Danglars , instead of being calmed by the soft picture , uttered a groan and fainted .
Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers , and guessed the subject of their parley .
Peppino , put out the torch. ” Peppino obeyed , and Franz and the count were in utter darkness , except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare , more evident since Peppino had put out his torch , was visible along the wall .
Speak !
They stopped at the sign of the Fox , in the Rue du Vieux Colombier , a tavern known for many years by Athos , and asked for two bedrooms .

Relate what has passed during the night , since these gentlemen desire to know it. ” “ Have you not taken a bastion ? ” said a Swiss , who was drinking rum out of a beer glass .
“ But there must be some cause for this strange scene. ” “ The Count of Morcerf ’ s adventure exasperates the young man. ” “ Have you anything to do with it ? ” “ It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his father ’ s treason. ” “ Indeed ? ” said Morrel .

His speech , therefore , was so well turned , that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh , they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule .
D ’ Artagnan ’ s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost .

The night was cold and still ; the family had all retired to rest but Villefort , who alone remained up , and worked till five o ’ clock in the morning , reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates , compiling the depositions of the witnesses , and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation , which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered .

D ’ Artagnan alone was calm , at least in appearance .
“ It is singular , ” said D ’ Artagnan , whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard , “ it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known , but who it was I can not yet remember. ” A few minutes later they were on board , but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men , and it was eight o ’ clock before they raised anchor .
“ But Raoul ? ” said Aramis .
“ We were merely joking ; drink to his health , ” he added , filling Caderousse ’ s glass , “ and do not interfere with us. ” “ Yes , yes , Dantès ’ good health ! ” said Caderousse , emptying his glass , “ here ’ s to his health !

Zounds !
“ Intact , my dear friend ; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and mine. ” “ But what is the use of harnesses without horses ? ” “ I have an idea about them. ” “ Athos , you make me shudder. ” “ Listen to me .

I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon , that excellent friend of mine , in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly. ” And D ’ Artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos , who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking .
You shall soon have something to drink ; I give you my word. ” “ If there is any left , ” grumbled the jeering voice of Athos .
D ’ Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away , and that he had committed an error .
He was in hunting costume covered with dust , wearing large boots , and holding a whip in his hand .
“ But , ” asked Madame Danglars , looking at her husband with uneasiness , “ how could that prevent M. de Villefort—— ” “ In this simple way , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence ; I therefore sent them to the king ’ s attorney .

Are the carbines loaded ? ” “ Yes , brigadier. ” “ Well , you guard the exterior , and if he attempts to fly , fire upon him ; he must be a great criminal , from what the telegraph says. ” The brigadier , followed by the commissary , disappeared by the inside staircase , accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd .

Nevertheless , you have not been forgotten in our plans , and we have fully ascertained beforehand that Valentine ’ s future husband will consent , not to live in this house , for that might not be pleasant for the young people , but that you should live with them ; so that you and Valentine , who are so attached to each other , would not be separated , and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done , and thus , instead of losing , you will be a gainer by the change , as it will secure to you two children instead of one , to watch over and comfort you. ” 30165m Noirtier ’ s look was furious ; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man ’ s mind , for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat , and not being able to find vent in utterance , appeared almost to choke him , for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle .
Look well at that man ; it is he who raised your father ’ s head on the point of a spear ; it is he who sold us ; it is he who forsook us !
At the door stood two horses , fresh , strong , and fully equipped .
Gondy smiled , the queen ’ s color rose and Mazarin grew even paler .
Albert was not deceived , for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner .
May I congratulate you ? ” “ The affair is still in projection. ” “ And he who says in ‘ projection , ’ means already decided , ” said Debray .
I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsed—but there will be a conference to-morrow and we shall see. ” The two friends saluted the duke .
The king and the cardinal are the best of friends ; their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools .
“ Not a step further , ” he shouted , “ the queen is signing ! ” “ What are you saying ? ” asked the queen .
But , at the same time , the intonation was so soft that , however strange the speech might seem , it was impossible to be offended at it .
This is what had happened : Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney , but then his foot slipped , and notwithstanding his endeavors , he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended .
I neither approve nor disapprove , my lord ; I merely await your commands. ” “ Good ; it is you , accordingly , that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain. ” “ Liar ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan .
In an instant he was among the branches , and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion .
“ Madame , ” said he , “ if I dared in my turn advise—— ” “ Would it be to give up Broussel , sir ?
But when Napoleon returned to Paris , Danglars ’ heart failed him , and he lived in constant fear of Dantès ’ return on a mission of vengeance .
For a mind so perspicuous as that of D ’ Artagnan , this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future .
“ And you disinherit your granddaughter , ” continued the notary , “ because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes ? ” “ Yes. ” “ So that , but for this marriage , she would have been your heir ? ” “ Yes. ” There was a profound silence .
Ah , if you could but help me—if we could both together defeat their plan !
Women say those things , but never do them. ” “ You do not know Mercédès ; what she threatens she will do. ” “ Idiot ! ” muttered Danglars ; “ whether she kill herself or not , what matter , provided Dantès is not captain ? ” “ Before Mercédès should die , ” replied Fernand , with the accents of unshaken resolution , “ I would die myself ! ” “ That ’ s what I call love ! ” said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever .
“ But , ” he said , “ Mouston is not so young as he was , my dear fellow ; besides , he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service. ” “ That may be true , ” replied Porthos ; “ but I am used to him , and besides , he wouldn ’ t be willing to let me go without him , he loves me so much. ” “ Oh , blind self-love ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan .
Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand ; and , instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton , he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder .
Follow us , Planchet ; we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village. ” They traversed the width of the village , talking of indifferent things , then as they reached the last houses : “ Go , then , dear friend , ” said Aramis , “ follow your own career .
“ It is not their fault that they are bandits , but that of the authorities. ” “ How so ? ” “ Because they are pursued for having made a stiff , as if it was not in a Corsican ’ s nature to revenge himself. ” “ What do you mean by having made a stiff ? —having assassinated a man ? ” said Franz , continuing his investigation .
The old patron did not interfere , for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself .
“ What number was it that rang ? ” “ Number 3. ” “ Run , waiter ! ” At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled .
So I went to Danglars , who would not even receive me .
We are leaving Paris , and when our journey is paid , we shall have 5,000 francs left. ” The blood mounted to the temples of Debray , who held a million in his pocket-book , and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women , one of whom , justly dishonored , had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak , while the other , unjustly stricken , but sublime in her misfortune , was yet rich with a few deniers .
“ It is evident , by their sending for me , that matters are becoming complicated .
They will then fancy it is an ambuscade , they will deliberate ; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry , we shall be out of the range of their balls .
M. Bonacieux was introduced afresh , and upon a sign from the cardinal , the officer retired .
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play .
Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter ; in short , he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man ; it was , therefore , on the footing of friends that D ’ Artagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Blois .
They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder ; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office , nor the corporal with his four men ; and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying .
Mme .
The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in France ; and , knowing your strict punctuality , have collected all the bills bearing your signature , and charged me as they became due to present them , and to employ the money otherwise. ” Morrel sighed deeply , and passed his hand over his forehead , which was covered with perspiration .
“ Here I am , my lord. ” “ Did you remark that man who is following us ? ” “ Yes , my lord. ” “ Who is he ? ” “ I do not know , only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal , stopped at the Louvre to wait for you , and now leaves the Louvre with you. ” “ Some spy of the cardinal , ” said De Winter to him , aside .
When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau , he raised his finger to his lips , to warn him to be silent , and , ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium , entered the chamber by the middle arcade , and advanced towards Vampa , who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps .
“ What am I to do ? ” “ Nothing very difficult. ” “ But what is it ? ” “ To repeat these signs. ” Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket , upon which were drawn three signs , with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked .
You can understand that one of two things must have happened ; he must either have fallen flat , in which case the blow , from a height of ninety feet , must have killed him instantly , or he must have fallen upright , and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom , where he remained—poor fellow ! ” “ Then you pity him ? ” said the count .
This timidity , which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt , conciliated some in his favor ; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred .
They passed into the next drawing-room , where tea was prepared .
“ I hope so. ” The friends embraced cordially ; D ’ Artagnan pressed Raoul ’ s hand .
Did you really think me capable of that ? ” “ At least , ” said the abbé , “ I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been .
“ Ah , ” said Morrel , falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair— “ ah , you are playing with me , like those good , or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words , because their screams annoy them .
“ Ah !
But , D ’ Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him .
You shall relate them to me , my child .
At eight o ’ clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before , except that D ’ Artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow .
“ You will excuse this poor fellow , madame , ” he said , as he preceded the baroness , “ but his orders are precise , and M. de Villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise. ” In the court showing his merchandise , was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions .
Then , after a moment of reverie , he remembered where he had left D ’ Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything .
The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by D ’ Artagnan , who accordingly , by an expressive glance , warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution .
Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Béthune .
An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms .
“ Frightful !
My friends will be there , I hope ; that is to say , you are invited , M. Danglars , and you , Caderousse. ” “ And Fernand , ” said Caderousse with a chuckle ; “ Fernand , too , is invited ! ” “ My wife ’ s brother is my brother , ” said Edmond ; “ and we , Mercédès and I , should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time. ” Fernand opened his mouth to reply , but his voice died on his lips , and he could not utter a word .
When I say one spoonful , I began by one—now I take four .
The two guards led the prisoner toward the table , and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything .
“ They will , no doubt , bleed him ; therefore I will retire , for I can not endure the sight of blood ; ” and she followed her husband upstairs .
“ You now understand , Haydée , ” said the count , “ that from this moment you are absolutely free ; that here you exercise unlimited sway , and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country , as it may suit your inclination .
“ And what do you know about the state you talk of ? ” said Mme .
Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder .
M. de Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news .
In fact , I am dead .
That was D ’ Artagnan ’ s road , as he was going to the Louvre .
“ Why are not my Frenchmen here ? ” he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; “ they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead. ” “ Well , ” said the president , seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent , “ so be it .
On his return home , Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray , and Morrel , to see them at the Opera that evening .
That door is guarded , D ’ Artagnan ; you know that. ” “ Very well , you will force it , ” said Porthos .
“ Then have a care , I repeat , for you seek to persuade me , and if you succeed I should lose my reason , for I should hope that I could again behold Valentine. ” The count smiled .
“ Descend , my lord , ” said the man in the moat .
Has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep ?
With a word , D ’ Artagnan reassured them ; and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer , as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal .
Danglars knew that he was heard , so he redoubled his blows .
Porthos ! ” murmured the Comte de la Fere .
but know you who he was ? ” “ He used to be the headsman of Bethune. ” “ You knew him ?
It was a strange thing , and one which made D ’ Artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair , to find that this soft light , this calm lamp , enlightened a scene of fearful disorder .
If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux , who recommends him to me , I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously. ” “ M .
Rage supplanted religious fervor .
“ Everything , D ’ Artagnan , even folly , has its limit. ” “ Then your means , it appears , are improved ; you have a capital house—your own , I presume ?
I only ate some fruit .
As soon as he arrives inform me .
I see that I have made a trifling mistake , as you say ; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon , that you may drink to my health , and be able to ask your messmates to join you. ” So extreme was the surprise of the sailor , that he was unable even to thank Edmond , whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment .
Nothing was changed .
On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage , it stopped .
“ And I also am to fight with this gentleman , ” said Aramis , coming in his turn onto the place .
Yes—that is a great word , sir .
Conceal your wounds when you have any ; silence is the last joy of the unhappy .
After the battle of Navarino , when the Greek government was consolidated , he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district , which was given him .
Do you know Saint-Mandrier ? ” “ I do. ” “ In the hour of rest , between noon and one o ’ clock—— ” “ Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner !
Until now , it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room , or under a long tent erected on the lawn , but the beautiful blue sky , studded with stars , had settled the question in favor of the lawn .
Guard her !
“ Empty ! ” he exclaimed ; “ the infernal demons ! ” “ We must pursue them , ” said Groslow , “ they can ’ t be gone far , and we will sink them , passing over them. ” “ Yes , but the fire , ” ejaculated Mordaunt ; “ I have lighted it. ” “ Ten thousand devils ! ” cried Groslow , rushing to the hatchway ; “ perhaps there is still time to save us. ” Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh , threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it .
We every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork , and some meat when he asks for it ; but alas !
You will find , in the same way , four relays on your route .
Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present .
Day gilded the tops of the houses .
no , never !
“ I am going to fire ! ” “ Gentlemen , ” exclaimed D ’ Artagnan , whom reflection never abandoned , “ gentlemen , think of what you are about .
Instead of lights at every window , as is customary on days of ceremony , he saw only a gray mass , which was veiled also by a cloud , which at that moment obscured the moon ’ s feeble light .
“ ‘ Nobody but ourselves , ’ replied Caderousse ; ‘ the fact is , we do not lodge travellers—indeed , our tavern is so near the town , that nobody would think of stopping here. ’ “ ‘ Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you. ’ “ ‘ Inconvenience us ?
Well , Ali , my Nubian , believes me to be an Arab ; Bertuccio , my steward , takes me for a Roman ; Haydée , my slave , thinks me a Greek .
“ He ’ s heavy , though , for an old and thin man , ” said one , as he raised the head .
Meanwhile let us sit down and eat. ” Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite , praising each dish he set before his visitor .
The moment for my escape is fixed—seven o ’ clock .
“ Thanks to the garden , we yet can flee ; I have the key , but make haste !
“ Do you place confidence in our landlord—Monsieur Bonacieux ? ” “ I ?
If it was Mme .
wrote , in a hand as small as possible , another note on the margin of his Horace , and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own , while he is only commenting upon the idea of another , said : “ Go on , my dear duke , go on—I listen. ” “ Sire , ” said Blacas , who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing Villefort to his own profit , “ I am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me ; but a serious-minded man , deserving all my confidence , and charged by me to watch over the south ” ( the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words ) , “ has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king , and so I hastened to you , sire. ” “ _Mala ducis avi domum_ , ” continued Louis XVIII. , still annotating .
Oh , I can not go without taking leave of her ; I can not die without confiding her to someone. ” He quietly regained his seat , and wrote under the other lines : “ I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel , captain of Spahis , —and son of my former patron , Pierre Morrel , shipowner at Marseilles , —the sum of twenty millions , a part of which may be offered to his sister Julie and brother-in-law Emmanuel , if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness .
The sailors did not require much urging .
Bazin was making , with his spare little short arms , ridiculous gestures .
All this was incomprehensible , and then , with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news , the failure was put off until the end of September .
Athos chose a black coat , which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen .
Remember , madame , if our God forbids falsehood , he much more severely condemns suicide. ” “ When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly , placed between suicide and dishonor , believe me , sir , ” replied Milady , in a tone of deep conviction , “ God pardons suicide , for then suicide becomes martyrdom. ” “ You say either too much or too little ; speak , madame .
“ It is he ! ” cried Bonacieux .
How will the crown , which is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV. , support a double weight ? ” “ The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril , ” interrupted the queen , with a sad smile , “ and I ask no more for my husband than has been done for me ; you see that we are very humble monarchs , sir. ” “ Oh , you , madame , ” the cardinal hastened to say , in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming , “ with regard to you , that is another thing .
Ah , yes , it is indeed strange ! ” And the wretched family departed , leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening .
You are a generous man , Albert , but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment ; if you refuse me , if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you , I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair. ” Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter .
But he did not succeed .
Are you satisfied , sir ? ” continued the notary , addressing the old man .
Only think , then , if Mademoiselle Danglars , instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie , had been named Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars ; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage ! ” “ Hush , ” said the count , “ do not joke in so loud a tone ; Haydée may hear you , perhaps. ” “ And you think she would be angry ? ” “ No , certainly not , ” said the count with a haughty expression .
Go , and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this. ” Charles rose and turned toward Parry , whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture .
“ Thanks , my lord , I will speak to him myself .
But , on the contrary , the particulars which are given prove that Fernand Mondego , raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general , is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf ; then , recollecting the honor you had done me , in admitting me to your friendship , I hastened to you. ” Albert , still extended on the chair , covered his face with both hands , as if to prevent the light from reaching him .
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you ; now that I see you , young and with a promising future , —now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure , I shudder at any delay , and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth. ” Edmond turned away his head with a sigh .
THE THREE PRESENTS OF D ’ ARTAGNAN THE ELDER On the first Monday of the month of April , 1625 , the market town of Meung , in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born , appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a second La Rochelle of it .
de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family. ” “ If such be the case , my dear Valentine , you must yourself have felt , or at all events will soon feel , the effects of his presence .
“ Now , ” said Planchet , “ let us thank the queen .
“ Well , ” said she , hardly giving Franz time to sit down , “ it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord Ruthven , and you are already the best friends in the world. ” “ Without being so far advanced as that , my dear countess , ” returned Franz , “ I can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day. ” “ All day ? ” “ Yes ; this morning we breakfasted with him ; we rode in his carriage all day , and now we have taken possession of his box. ” “ You know him , then ? ” “ Yes , and no. ” “ How so ? ” “ It is a long story. ” “ Tell it to me. ” “ It would frighten you too much. ” “ So much the more reason. ” “ At least wait until the story has a conclusion. ” “ Very well ; I prefer complete histories ; but tell me how you made his acquaintance ?
give way ! ” At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head , but it was too late .
“ Let us speak of my affairs , ” said Mazarin , “ since you will tell me naught of yours .
“ Now to supper , ” said Aramis .
“ Monsieur , ” said the cardinal , “ are you a D ’ Artagnan from Béarn ? ” “ Yes , monseigneur , ” replied the young man .
“ Sir , ” said Valentine , “ my grandfather wishes for a notary. ” At this strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged looks .
He wrote the same day for the required information to M. de Boville , who , from having been an inspector of prisons , was promoted to a high office in the police ; and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars .
Pardon me , and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace ? ” “ You are a brave young man , ” said Buckingham , holding out his hand to D ’ Artagnan , who pressed it respectfully .
You will tell me that I am a living being , and not a code—a man , and not a volume .
“ Gentlemen , ” said Mazarin , “ I join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects .
The Secret Cave The sun had nearly reached the meridian , and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks , which seemed themselves sensible of the heat .
“ D ’ Artagnan , ” said Athos , taking his hand , “ you know I love you ; if I had a son I could not love him better .
During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state , Valentine ’ s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man ’ s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted .
“ I took then , in conformity with the orders of the authorities , who sent me a reinforcement of six men , such measures as I thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners. ” “ Again ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners_ .
“ You called me , didn ’ t you ? ” And he fell , rather than sat down , on one of the seats which surrounded the table .
“ Who , then , has so correctly informed you ? ” asked he ; “ for my paper , which gave the first information on the subject , has been obliged to stop for want of proof ; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf , as he is a peer of France , and we are of the opposition. ” “ Oh , that is very simple ; we have not sought to scandalize .
Danglars then opened the window .
I could not see the expression of his countenance , but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed .
Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought ; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them , and nothing is outwardly apparent .
And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès , who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son .
“ Poor Fernand has been dismissed , ” continued Caderousse .
There you stood , stammering , stupefied , annihilated .
You never knew her. ” “ Eh , madame , who knows ? ” said Athos .
D ’ Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their companions , and all four set forward ; Athos upon a horse he owed to a woman , Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress , Porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator ’ s wife , and D ’ Artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune—the best mistress possible .
Yours is a pretty business. ” “ But , ” said the agitated mercer , “ do me the pleasure , monsieur , to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while I am in prison ? ” “ Because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you—of an infernal plan. ” “ I swear to you , Monsieur Commissary , that you are in the profoundest error , that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do , that I am entirely a stranger to what she has done ; and that if she has committed any follies , I renounce her , I abjure her , I curse her ! ” “ Bah ! ” said Athos to the commissary , “ if you have no more need of me , send me somewhere .
“ Save me , I am pursued ! ” said Andrea , clasping his hands .
“ Good-morning , my dear host , ” cried D ’ Artagnan .
I am as poor as Job , and were you to search my pockets and my boxes I don ’ t believe you would find a hundred pistoles. ” “ Peste !
I could not defer my pleasure , so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer ’ s .
“ That ’ s it , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ you , Monsieur le Comte de la Fere , to the right of Monsieur Groslow .
“ I think so , ” answered Albert in a firm tone .
I love that humiliation , I , who am master of the universe , as was Augustus. ” “ But where are you really going ? ” “ To sea , viscount ; you know I am a sailor .
All four once more together .
“ Ah , gentlemen , ” he cried , as the two friends entered , “ you are very happy !
He was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry , and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even Louis XIII .
His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey , and his lips , half opened , disclosed his white teeth , small and sharp like those of a jackal .
“ Ah ! ” said Milady , listening in her turn to the noise of Felton ’ s steps , which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter ; “ at length you are mine ! ” Then her brow darkened .
Now , on taking prisoners , this morning , two Frenchmen , who seemed to me of high birth—in short , two knights of the Garter—I said to myself , my fortune is made .
The sum was collected in a minute .
“ Well , I shall see .
God ’ s death , don ’ t fire ! ” screamed D ’ Artagnan , throwing open the window .
_Coupé_ , thirty-five francs ........ .............. ........ 35 .
M. Noirtier de Villefort Chapter 59 .
Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air , and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there .
If my brow be severe , it is because many misfortunes have clouded it ; if my heart be petrified , it is that it might sustain the blows it has received .
Each was anxious to gain admission before the other .
You will give them to your son , who will , of course , take great care of them. ” “ I should think so , indeed !
A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos : “ If Athos knows where we are , if he opens communication with us , before long Athos will act. ” Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances , but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea , he understood .
“ And what was most frightful , ” continued Milady , her voice altered , as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute , “ was that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me ; was that my soul , if I may say so , waked in my sleeping body ; was that I saw , that I heard .
“ My Lord , excuse me !
“ My name is Mordaunt , ” replied the young man , bowing .
Aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs , and then immediately came up again to D ’ Artagnan , whose senses were still in a state of confusion .
Morcerf ’ s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow .
just so .
I won ’ t have him killed—I won ’ t !
“ Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs , ” said Lord Wilmore ; “ he is a miser. ” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman , who , knowing no other reproach to bring on the count , accused him of avarice .
He was a Berrichon , thirty-five or forty years old , mild , peaceable , sleek , employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works , providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes , but excellent .
Now , then , what had I better do ? ” “ Return instantly .
As I before said , I thought the whole thing was a joke , nothing more .
The celebrated breviary remained in the family , and was in the count ’ s possession .
faithless court !
In one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands. ” While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken , on D ’ Artagnan ’ s finger , the place of the queen ’ s ring , carefully kept in a casket .
A thousand livres !
On beholding this house , D ’ Artagnan , calm as he was in general , felt an unusual disturbance within his heart—so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth .
Who should it be but he who watches while I sleep , who labors while I amuse myself , who conducts everything at home and abroad—in France as in Europe ? ” “ Your Majesty probably refers to God , ” said M. de Tréville ; “ for I know no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty. ” “ No , monsieur ; I speak of the prop of the state , of my only servant , of my only friend—of the cardinal. ” “ His Eminence is not his holiness , sire. ” “ What do you mean by that , monsieur ? ” “ That it is only the Pope who is infallible , and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals. ” “ You mean to say that he deceives me ; you mean to say that he betrays me ?
“ I believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband. ” “ But , monsieur , you know then— ” “ I know that you have been abducted , madame. ” “ And by whom ?
In an instant , thanks to the lamp , my chamber was once more lighted .
Philosophers may well say , and practical men will always support the opinion , that money mitigates many trials ; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm , you ought to be very easily consoled—you , the king of finance , the focus of immeasurable power. ” Danglars looked at him askance , as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously .
My friend , you impose a painful task on me .
“ Some one must go for help , ” said a lad , who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man , who was so large .
I am at present in the midst of war , and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles .
If there are three , let yourself be slain , but save the king. ” “ Be easy , ” said Aramis ; “ I will take two poniards and give one to Parry .
“ A note which you will find at home will tell you .

If at this moment the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy , or the fair Mercédès had entered and said , “ In the name of God , I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband , ” his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release ; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber , and the door was opened only by Villefort ’ s valet , who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness .
But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against you .
I will write to him , then , nearly in these terms. ” “ Let us see , ” said Athos , assuming in advance a critical look .

One of them took his gun by the barrel , and used it as he would a club .
Order ; I am ready. ” “ For everything ? ” “ For everything , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus .

D ’ Artagnan bent down to his horse ’ s neck , the young man fired , and the ball severed the feathers from the hat .
Although of a paleness that was almost livid , this man had a remarkably handsome face ; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling ; his nose , quite straight , and projecting direct from the brow , was of the pure Greek type , while his teeth , as white as pearls , were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them .
As this was the height of D ’ Artagnan ’ s worldly ambition—apart , be it well understood , from his desire of finding Mme .
“ What would you have me say ? ” “ Give all the information in your power. ” “ Tell me on which point you desire information , and I will tell all I know ; only , ” added he , with a smile , “ I warn you I know very little. ” “ Have you served under the usurper ? ” “ I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell. ” “ It is reported your political opinions are extreme , ” said Villefort , who had never heard anything of the kind , but was not sorry to make this inquiry , as if it were an accusation .
Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath .
Have you kept him in the cellar all this time ? ” “ Merciful heaven !
Not at all ? ” “ Why , just think for a moment ; with this red handkerchief on my head , with scarcely any shoes , no papers , and ten gold napoleons in my pocket , without reckoning what was there before—making in all about two hundred francs , —why , I should certainly be arrested at the barriers .

Keep your journey a secret ; do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do , or have done ; return with all speed ; enter Marseilles at night , and your house by the back-door , and there remain , quiet , submissive , secret , and , above all , inoffensive ; for this time , I swear to you , we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies .
Without uttering a word , they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion .

Now , it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess. ” “ Two years ! ” exclaimed Dantès ; “ do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time ? ” “ Not their application , certainly , but their principles you may ; to learn is not to know ; there are the learners and the learned .
“ Speak , doctor—I am listening , ” said Villefort ; “ strike—I am prepared for everything ! ” “ Madame de Saint-Méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health. ” Morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes .
In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil ; the steward ’ s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village .

Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees ? —that poor innocent offspring of mine , which I never even kissed , but for whom I wept many , many tears .

In fact , four men such as they were—four men devoted to one another , from their purses to their lives ; four men always supporting one another , never yielding , executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common ; four arms threatening the four cardinal points , or turning toward a single point—must inevitably , either subterraneously , in open day , by mining , in the trench , by cunning , or by force , open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain , however well it might be defended , or however distant it may seem .
You are aware , sir , of the deplorable condition of my husband ’ s father ? ” “ Yes , madame , M. de Villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis , I think. ” “ Alas , yes ; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless ; the mind alone is still active in this human machine , and that is faint and flickering , like the light of a lamp about to expire .
“ Well , ” said he to Morcerf , “ but I think your father will not be the only angry one ; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person .
onward ! ” cried the Gascon .
He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major ’ s little finger ; for the major , like a prudent man , in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes , had immediately converted them into an available asset .

To-morrow , according to all probability , we shall attack the enemy. ” “ But , my lord , ” said Marshal de Grammont , “ consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men. ” “ Monsieur le marechal , ” said the prince , with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him , “ it is with small armies that great battles are won. ” Then turning toward the prisoner , “ Take away that man , ” he said , “ and keep him carefully in sight .
Endeavor , then , to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome , Florence , Milan , and Madrid ; it may be useful to you one of these days , whether you remain here or return to the East. ” The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness , “ Whether _we_ return to the East , you mean to say , my lord , do you not ? ” “ My child , ” returned Monte Cristo “ you know full well that whenever we part , it will be no fault or wish of mine ; the tree forsakes not the flower—the flower falls from the tree. ” “ My lord , ” replied Haydée , “ I never will leave you , for I am sure I could not exist without you. ” “ My poor girl , in ten years I shall be old , and you will be still young. ” “ My father had a long white beard , but I loved him ; he was sixty years old , but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw. ” “ Then tell me , Haydée , do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life ? ” “ Shall I see you ? ” “ Every day. ” “ Then what do you fear , my lord ? ” “ You might find it dull. ” “ No , my lord .
An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles .

At nine o ’ clock the night had fully come .
The king had not yet returned from hunting .
Then , when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and was consequently relieved of doubts , he said : “ Thanks , madame , —thanks for your punctuality ; ” and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars , which she accepted , for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated .
Three times did the bell ring with a dull , heavy sound , seeming to participate , in the general sadness , before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door , which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard .
Four hours later he was in Neufchâtel .

“ What is he doing up there ? ” And they called Château-Renaud ’ s attention to him .
Well , I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [ people spoke in this style in 1815 ] , that of not being able to call a day my own , not even that of my betrothal. ” “ And wherefore were you called away just now ? ” asked Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , with an air of deep interest .
I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination. ” “ A problem , my dear count , for everyone—for my mother as well as others ; much studied , but not solved , you still remain an enigma , do not fear .

One of your ancestors had joined the Crusades , and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis , that makes you mount to the thirteenth century , which is tolerably ancient. ” “ It is possible , ” said Morcerf ; “ my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that , and on which I made commentaries that would have greatly edified d ’ Hozier and Jaucourt .

“ For me !
“ I don ’ t think so , ” answered the other ; “ he ’ s too stupid to imagine such a scheme .
What is become of them ? ” “ You are very generous , gentlemen of the Guards , ” said Athos , full of rancor , for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day .
He was placed before a large glass , which reflected the whole apartment , and so , without any attempt to move , which would have been impossible , he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him .

D ’ Artagnan remained all day in his quarters , assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad .
I can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render .

“ To the smaller. ” “ I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen. ” “ Well , what has happened to them ? ” “ They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons , who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate. ” “ Eight ! ” said Aramis ; “ it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and D ’ Artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men. ” “ The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the king ’ s service , who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers. ” “ Arrested , were they ? ” inquired Athos ; “ is it known why ? ” “ No , sir , they were carried off instantly , and had not even time to tell me why ; but as soon as they were gone I found this broken sword-blade , as I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones. ” “ ’ Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded , ” said Aramis .

Rare birds , retaining their most brilliant plumage , enormous fish , spread upon massive silver dishes , together with every wine produced in the Archipelago , Asia Minor , or the Cape , sparkling in bottles , whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught , —all these , like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests , passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians , who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons , but only on the condition of eating pearls , like Cleopatra , or drinking refined gold , like Lorenzo de ’ Medici .
“ Yes. ” “ Without accident ? ” “ Perfectly safe and sound. ” “ Porthos , whilst I get up , watch the cardinal .
I see you know him , ” exclaimed the wife ; “ for you have become pale in your turn. ” “ Truly , ” cried the host , “ misfortune is coming on our house ; it is the former executioner of Bethune. ” “ The former executioner of Bethune ! ” murmured the young monk , shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired .
Athos and Aramis followed him .
“ You see ? ” he said to Porthos .
Poet as I am , I am intimate with Sarazin , who is devoted to the Prince de Conti , and with Monsieur de Bois-Robert , who , since the death of Cardinal Richelieu , is of all parties or any party ; so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me. ” “ I have no doubt of it , ” said D ’ Artagnan .

Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments , I shall find one both palpable and visible , on whom I shall revenge myself , I assure you , for all I have suffered during the last month .
“ Is this carriage for me ? ” said Dantès .
We take him to the other side of the French frontier , and offer him hospitality at Bourges. ” “ At Bourges ? ” “ Yes , he has not much to complain of ; Bourges is the capital of Charles VII .

On the left , in a sort of valley , he perceived a circular excavation .
It is God ’ s pleasure that things should be so. ” The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village , so called , situated between Salon and Lambesc ; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation , her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine , which , in all probability , his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce .

He had received a ball in his thigh , which had broken the bone .
The others , attracted by curiosity , were already scattered in different parts of the house ; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room , and that , at the same time , they would obtain a view of the rest of the building , of which Monte Cristo had created a palace .
“ He wants to be sure that I go away , ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself .
Then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him—they represent the wealth of the country ; nor the nobles nor the princes , who are the military power of France. ” D ’ Artagnan scratched his ear .
Planchet , who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade , declared that he would follow D ’ Artagnan even to the end of the world , either by the road to the right or by that to the left ; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening , for greater security to himself .
Each time he had been brought into contact with his father , something terrible had happened .
The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead , and her eyes , already sunken by the furrows of age , now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief .

D ’ Artagnan charged , with a party of musketeers , up the Rue du Coq , and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke , dispersing near the Place Saint Germain-l ’ Auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays .
The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other—not that M. d ’ Artagnan did not love his son , who was his only offspring , but M. d ’ Artagnan was a man , and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings ; whereas Mme .
Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musketeer .
Well , Edmond , I swear to you , by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pity , —Edmond , for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy , and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me , shuddering and cold .
Her husband , who , when he married her , had no other patrimony than his noble probity , his first-rate ability , and his spotless reputation , wished to possess as much as his wife .

However , the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another , and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him .
another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt .
Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me , and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require. ” This manner of acting roused much respect for D ’ Artagnan ’ s policy among the Musketeers .
I wished to make my adieux to you , but time does not permit .
So , if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first—— ” “ Oh !

Felton , ” said Buckingham , “ you will withdraw , and place yourself at once under arrest. ” “ You will hear me to the end , my Lord .
“ Let us go , you mean ? ” “ No , my friend , ” said Athos , “ you must leave us. ” “ Leave you ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement .
“ Ah , wretch ! ” cried she , “ you have basely betrayed me , and still more , you have my secret !

“ You asked for candor and you have it .
“ Yes , the servant has given his description .
Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives , and that , in all human probability , will be the hour of my death .
Life is so uncertain , that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach. ” “ Well , sir , ” said Danglars , “ in case your proposals , which do me honor , are accepted by my wife and daughter , by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled ?
Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment .
A quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal .
There the great number of inns puzzled them ; they could not go to all ; how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed ?
Monsieur Athos , do me , then , the honor to accompany me ; you and your two friends , and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty , if we should meet him. ” The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses .

Well , by means of these lines , which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth , and the ellipse it describes round the sun , I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch ; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements , while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths. ” This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès , who had always imagined , from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean , that it moved , and not the earth .
Do I regret life ?

And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person .
“ ‘ To whom , then ? ’ — ‘ To your new master. ’ “ ‘ Who and where is he ? ’ — ‘ He is here. ’ “ And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father , ” said Haydée , in a tone of chastened anger .
Charles , without replying a single word , turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it .
“ I wish , after such a scene , to be alone. ” Mazarin bent low before her .

However , I have turned the business over to Morcerf , so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you ; for my own part , I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings. ” 30093m “ I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs , wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs each. ” “ He seems to have a mania for diamonds , ” said Morcerf , smiling , “ and I verily believe that , like Potemkin , he keeps his pockets filled , for the sake of strewing them along the road , as Tom Thumb did his flint stones. ” “ Perhaps he has discovered some mine , ” said Madame Danglars .
The night was extremely dark .
“ Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you , sir , ” he said , “ that eleven o ’ clock has just struck , and that the trial commences at twelve. ” “ Well , ” said Villefort , “ what then ? ” “ Madame de Villefort is dressed ; she is quite ready , and wishes to know if she is to accompany you , sir ? ” “ Where to ? ” “ To the Palais. ” “ What to do ? ” “ My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial. ” “ Ah , ” said Villefort , with a startling accent ; “ does she wish that ? ” The servant drew back and said , “ If you wish to go alone , sir , I will go and tell my mistress. ” Villefort remained silent for a moment , and dented his pale cheeks with his nails .
But instead of going to her own room , Valentine , having once gained her liberty , entered the gallery , and , opening a small door at the end of it , found herself at once in the garden .
“ Yes , no doubt .
“ Read ? ” he said .
LOVER AND HUSBAND Chapter XIX .
All that he was allowed to say , in case of emergencies , was the proverbial Der Teufel !
Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was , without the owner knowing who he was ; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “ pump ” him , they extracted nothing more from him ; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta , which he knew as well as Marseilles , and held stoutly to his first story .
Orders were given that no drum should be beaten , no trumpet sounded .
“ At length I heard the well-known noise of the door , which opened and shut ; I heard , notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet , a step which made the floor creak ; I saw , notwithstanding the darkness , a shadow which approached my bed. ” “ Haste !
“ But , ” said he , “ so long as I do remain in Paris , and nothing forces me to quit it , do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me ? ” “ You may. ” “ Shall I receive it from my father ? ” asked Andrea , with some uneasiness .
Truly , sir , you overwhelm me with benefits ! ” “ Therefore you love me a little , I hope , ” replied Athos , in a tone of emotion .
His horse bounded to one side , losing its footing , and fell , entangling Raoul ’ s leg under its body .
The great Pompey lost that of Pharsalia ; and Francis the First , who was , as I have heard say , as good as other folks , nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia. ” “ And I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with his own sword , ” said Aramis ; “ for mine was broken at the first parry .

Bonacieux .
It is twelve o ’ clock , Maximilian ; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening , or tomorrow morning .

“ Have you observed , ” said he to them , “ what a blood-red color the moon has to-night ? ” “ No , ” replied Athos ; “ I thought it looked much the same as usual. ” “ Look , again , chevalier , ” returned Lord Winter .
Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount , in which , without assigning any reason , he begged him to go to the Opera , but he understood that something terrible was brooding .

Athos has been arrested. ” “ Yesterday , at Saint Germain , as he came out from the presence of the queen. ” The arms of D ’ Artagnan fell powerless by his side .
we don ’ t want either rope ladders or gag-pears now. ” “ My lord , ” said Athos , “ do not let us disturb you .

With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details .

Then walking towards Morrel , he took his hand ; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor .
“ Well ?
Nevertheless , as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends , the Rochellais continued to advance in quick time .
Then , when the cardinal had ended : “ Alas , sir !
His shoulder-knots were of burnished silver , his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it ; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat ; his boots were of black leather , and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue Feron .
I ’ m not the man you take me for ; you are in Captain Rogers ’ s post , are you not ?
Why is he not here that I may tell him so ? ” “ Sir , ” replied Monte Cristo coldly , “ I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs .
“ It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard , or a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée. ” “ Never mind what he says , Morcerf , ” said Debray , “ do you marry her .
A physician was sought for , but none was yet found .
“ Keep guard at the other door , Athos and Aramis .
You have doubtless heard of these massacres , your excellency ? ” “ Vaguely ; I was far from France at that period .
Listen , Morrel—it is noon ; if Valentine is not now dead , she will not die. ” “ How so ? ” cried Morrel , “ when I left her dying ? ” Monte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead .
“ Yes , undoubtedly , the Abbé Busoni himself , ” replied Monte Cristo .
The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls , which were picked up by La Ramee and the guard .
You can not for a moment imagine , D ’ Artagnan , that I would commit such an offense toward— ” “ The unknown giver , ” interrupted D ’ Artagnan .
The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors ; and , as I have said , the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator , they every moment burst into fits of laughter .
“ On the contrary , ” observed D ’ Artagnan , with a vexed look ; “ it would be impossible. ” “ How so ? ” “ It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to England. ” “ Well , suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go and join our friends ? ” said Porthos , with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army .
The hinges yielded in their turn and fell , still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood , and the chest was open .
At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal , like the forms that appear in dreams .
But this time the papers were a mere matter of form .
Had we not better lower our heads ? ” “ In truth , ” murmured D ’ Artagnan , to whom M. de Tréville ’ s recommendation recurred , “ this animal will end by making me afraid. ” And he put his horse into a trot .
Evening came , and still , with all the patient solicitude of a mother , she watched for his return .
“ Well , now you understand , mother ! ” continued Albert ; “ here are more than 4,000 francs settled on you ; upon these you can live at least two years. ” “ Do you think so ? ” said Mercédès .
You were not of the party , M. de Morcerf ? ” “ What prince ? ” asked Albert .
I had but to write to the Duchesse—but I won ’ t repeat her name , for I am incapable of compromising a woman ; but this I know , that I had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred. ” The procurator ’ s wife shed a tear .
“ I do not often laugh , sir , ” replied the stranger , “ as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance ; but nevertheless I retain the privilege of laughing when I please. ” “ And I , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me ! ” “ Indeed , sir , ” continued the stranger , more calm than ever ; “ well , that is perfectly right ! ” and turning on his heel , was about to re-enter the hostelry by the front gate , beneath which D ’ Artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse .
Go on. ” “ It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter , and , as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road , I resolved not to break through the rule , so climbing over the garden-hedge , I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees , and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest , I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night , and which was only separated from the inn by a partition , in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence .
More pale and menacing than Athos , D ’ Artagnan stood on the threshold .
I will see about the continuation of it , and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied with the corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice. ” “ Work slowly , ” said the curate ; “ we leave you in an excellent tone of mind. ” “ Yes , the ground is all sown , ” said the Jesuit , “ and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone , another upon the highway , or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest , _aves cœli comederunt illam_. ” “ Plague stifle you and your Latin ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to feel all his patience exhausted .
“ As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be , ” replied Maximilian .
Villefort ’ s conduct , therefore , upon reflection , appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage .
England needs tranquillity at home , in order to consummate the expulsion of her king ; France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch .
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to Albert .
M. d ’ Avrigny opened the door , and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup , he then carefully closed the door .
Madame Danglars therefore came , not only beautiful in person , but radiant with splendor ; she entered by one door at the time when Mercédès appeared at the door .
“ Be it then as you desire .
A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded .
“ That ’ s well , ” said Athos , “ let us go home and read it. ” The note burned the hand of D ’ Artagnan .
On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach , and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month , and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel , and his cashier Cocles , to meet the creditors .
He consequently sprang up again , re-entered the office , with a turn of his finger set the clock right again , that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong , and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi , he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street .
He was wrong to leave it there , but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him .

Well , ever since then , the infernal project has been ripening in her brain. ” “ Ah , then , indeed , sir , ” said the sweet girl , bathed in tears , “ I see that I am condemned to die ! ” “ No , Valentine , for I have foreseen all their plots ; no , your enemy is conquered since we know her , and you will live , Valentine—live to be happy yourself , and to confer happiness upon a noble heart ; but to insure this you must rely on me. ” “ Command me , sir—what am I to do ? ” “ You must blindly take what I give you. ” “ Alas , were it only for my own sake , I should prefer to die ! ” “ You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father. ” “ My father is not engaged in this fearful plot , is he , sir ? ” asked Valentine , clasping her hands .
The king is either a king or no king ; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France , he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity ; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy— ’ tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief. ” “ Unfortunately , madame , ” answered Villefort , “ the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place. ” “ Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it. ” “ Nay , madame , the law is frequently powerless to effect this ; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done. ” “ Oh , M. de Villefort , ” cried a beautiful young creature , daughter to the Comte de Salvieux , and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , “ do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles .
He could not help thinking of M. Rochefort , whom he had seen in Notre Dame ; could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos ?
Then they did not watch over this man .

Come , have you committed some crime , pursued by human justice , from which I can protect you ? ” The beggar shook his head .
It is I who lose my cause , and it is ill-luck , obstinacy , and folly which have caused it to be decided against me. ” “ To what do you refer ? ” said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest .
Thus all may go well—all may be for the best ; but we do not go far from this place ? ” “ Seven or eight leagues at the most .
Beneath these lines was written in another hand : “ See note above—nothing can be done. ” He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrel ’ s petition , and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to say , was in Villefort ’ s handwriting .
But this confession concerns me only .
Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth. ” But Mazarin , notwithstanding this permission , instead of reading the letters , took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen .
There is but one service I can render you , and for that I place myself entirely at your orders , that is , to present , or make my friends present , you everywhere ; besides , you have no need of anyone to introduce you—with your name , and your fortune , and your talent ” ( Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile ) “ you can present yourself everywhere , and be well received .
Dantès seized the handles , and strove to lift the coffer ; it was impossible .
“ When one is going to be married , there is nothing like implicit confidence ; but never mind that , my boy , —go and announce your arrival , and let her know all your hopes and prospects. ” “ I will go directly , ” was Edmond ’ s reply ; and , embracing his father , and nodding to Caderousse , he left the apartment .

friend , the cardinal , although such a genius , could never have done that. ” “ Shall I take out any more of them ? ” asked Porthos .
Here I await the army of my rebellious subjects .
Soon as Kitty left him , D ’ Artagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Férou .
one thing now is only awanting and that is , that our grooms should not keep us waiting. ” “ No , ” said Athos .
I might have handed him over to Roman justice , which is somewhat expeditious , and which would have been particularly so with him ; but I did nothing of the sort—I suffered him and his band to depart. ” “ With the condition that they should sin no more , ” said Beauchamp , laughing .
Almost mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more , and be certain of the misfortune he feared , Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees , and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden , when the sound of a voice , still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him .
The whole intrigue is political , and there is not the least question of love in this letter ; but , on the other hand , there is abundant question of you. ” The cardinal took the letter , and read it with the greatest attention ; then , when he had arrived at the end of it , he read it a second time .
“ Stay ! ” said D ’ Artagnan ; and taking out his handkerchief , he gagged him .
There must be plenty left , ” replied D ’ Artagnan .

Look. ” “ That is right , ” replied the mendicant ; “ dismiss your lackey. ” In fact , Bazin , curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master , kept pace with him as well as he could , and arrived almost at the same time he did ; but his quickness was not of much use to him .
An instant after , Porthos and Aramis re-entered , the surgeon and M. de Tréville alone remaining with the wounded .
Monte Cristo took the glass , drank half its contents , and then presented it to Valentine , who smiled and swallowed the rest .
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin .
No , I repeat again , that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty ’ s pleasure. ” Dantès held down his head , that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé ’ s plans .
“ And I , too , ” murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes .
“ You are the child of my captivity .
I bought my experience dearly—particularly fair women .
“ Fine spoil , captain , fine spoil ! ” said Peppino in Italian , and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door , through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place .
This foraging did not occupy more than half an hour .
I am the queen ; do you recognize me ? ” “ No , madame , ” replied D ’ Artagnan .
“ Let us follow him , ” said De Guiche ; “ it will be the surest plan. ” “ I was about to propose so doing , ” answered De Bragelonne .
“ It is well , ” said the abbé ; “ we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o ’ clock. ” Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour .
“ A knife , which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it , ” replied Felton .
Is that all you want ? ” “ Yes. ” Valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier ’ s room .
So , my dear mother , I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants. ” “ You , my poor child , suffer poverty and hunger ?
“ Barrois , ” said the doctor , “ can you speak ? ” Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words .
Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him .
But how ?
Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening , as when he has completely disappeared .
On Saturday I will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph. ” At the door the count was met by the two notaries , who had just completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine , and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit .
He mentioned this to Gaetano , who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat , bread , wine , half a dozen partridges , and a good fire to roast them by .
_Morbleu ! _ You must know something about it .
The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs ; and that the footsteps , which were those of several persons , stopped at the door .
‘ All hands to the pumps ! ’ I shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in .
The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning , ‘ The subject has died of a tumor on the liver , or of typhoid fever ! ’ ” “ But , ” remarked Madame de Villefort , “ all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident ; the vulture may not see the fowl , or may fall a hundred yards from the fish-pond. ” “ Ah , that is where the art comes in .
Besides , the king , I am certain , awaits your majesty ’ s reply before risking anything. ” “ You will tell him , my lord , ” resumed the queen , despairingly , “ that I can do nothing ; that I have suffered as much as himself—more than he has—obliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears ; and as regards his royal person , he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king .
‘ Who are you ? ’ cried Selim .
You know that it was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedetto .
Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident , Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed .
“ I ?
As for our two prisoners , you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation. ” “ They are hot royalists , ” said Groslow .
He stepped forward .
“ Yes , ” replied Albert , raising his voice .
“ I once , ” she said , “ despised the love of a cardinal who never said ‘ I shall do , ’ but , ‘ I have done so and so. ’ That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil , darker and more silent even than the Bastile .
0345m Some time after , it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf ( this was the name he bore ) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general .
In fact , after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread , Charles , weary of waiting for death , had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement .
‘ I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump , ’ said he. ” “ Well done ! ” said the Englishman .
At a quarter to ten , a valet entered ; he composed , with a little groom named John , and who only spoke English , all Albert ’ s establishment , although the cook of the hotel was always at his service , and on great occasions the count ’ s _chasseur_ also .
But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin , who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might .
Three of my best soldiers , whom your Majesty knows by name , and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated , and who have , I dare affirm to the king , his service much at heart—three of my best soldiers , I say , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from Gascony , whom I had introduced to them the same morning .
But what can they intend to do with the poor creature , and how shall I ever meet her again ? ” “ Friend , ” said Athos , gravely , “ remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth .
We traveled five or six leagues , serious , silent , and almost without speaking .
Keep watch from seven to nine .
And what do you know about them , Monsieur ?
The editor was reading , with apparent delight , a leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar , probably a composition of his own .
“ Well , sir , ” resumed Danglars , after a brief silence , “ I will endeavor to make myself understood , by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me ? ” “ Why , truly , ” replied Monte Cristo , determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained , “ my reason for desiring an ‘ unlimited ’ credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need. ” The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand .
Morrel guessed all this .
Come—do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is capable ?
“ But you will remain ; you are not afraid ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , coming back to recommend courage to his lackey .
“ You do not understand me , gentlemen , ” said D ’ Artagnan , throwing up his head , the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun .
“ I remember now ; yes , it was about—stop a minute—yes , it was about a woman. ” “ That ’ s it , ” replied Athos , becoming almost livid ; “ that is my grand story of the fair lady , and when I relate that , I must be very drunk. ” “ Yes , that was it , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ the story of a tall , fair lady , with blue eyes. ” “ Yes , who was hanged. ” “ By her husband , who was a nobleman of your acquaintance , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , looking intently at Athos .
“ ‘ Very well , ’ cried I , ‘ then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb .
Pray , was not Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , in the time of the cardinal , mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out , according to report , quite cleverly ? ” “ My lord , as to the report you allude to ” —Guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out— “ I know nothing but what the public knows .
The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls , over which the sun glances obliquely , when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity .
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Athos .
Do you find the means , I will execute it , provided it is not to kill the man , for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is killed. ” Caderousse , who had let his head drop on the table , now raised it , and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes , he said , “ Kill Dantès !
“ Nothing would be more easy , ” said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail , “ but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal. ” “ I have that permission , ” said the gentleman , drawing the paper from his pocket ; “ here it is. ” “ Have it examined by the governor of the port , ” said the shipmaster , “ and give me the preference. ” “ Where shall I find the governor ? ” “ At his country house. ” “ And that is situated ? ” “ At a quarter of a league from the city .
Many observations were made , the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room .
“ Mr .
The Palais de Justice communicated with the prison , —a sombre edifice , that from its grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules .
Then I thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers , and that then she would suppose I was your accomplice ; so I took what little money I had and the best of my things , and I got away .
As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure , I saw she would ere long become a mother .
oh , I would advance ten millions on his signature .
But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion ?

D ’ Artagnan , believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape , drew a pistol from his belt ; but Athos raised his hand .
Morrel opened the door , and closed it behind his son ; then , crossing the anteroom , went to his desk on which he placed the pistols , and pointed with his finger to an open ledger .
I would then rather die. ” “ Truly , ” murmured Valentine , “ who on this earth cares for me , if he does not ?
It was the same through which , twenty-four years ago , he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard ; the houses , today so smiling and animated , were on that night dark , mute , and closed .
Dantès followed him with his eyes , and stretched forth his hands towards the open door ; but the door closed .
“ Monsieur , ” said the prince , turning toward Raoul , “ I know that you have a letter from my sister , Madame de Longueville ; but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel. ” “ My lord , ” said Raoul , coloring up , “ I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count .

About a year ago , I talked of retiring to a convent .
This was to go himself to M. de la Trémouille .
I like everyone. ” “ And you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks ! ” “ Let us not mistake , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I love everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor , as Christians ; but I thoroughly hate but a few .
Cardinal , I must have the queen ’ s papers. ” “ But how to take them , sire ?
He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner , close to La Ramee ’ s heart , that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination .
No one better. ” “ Speak out then , say what it was ! ” “ Gaspard ! ” cried La Carconte , “ do as you will ; you are master—but if you take my advice you ’ ll hold your tongue. ” “ Well , wife , ” replied Caderousse , “ I don ’ t know but what you ’ re right ! ” “ So you will say nothing ? ” asked the abbé .
But after he had gone about two hundred steps D ’ Artagnan stopped short , alighted , threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle .
Besides , he doesn ’ t know you ; like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan. ” “ Very well ; let us go. ” They then went down to the Thames .
“ It is you , Monsieur D ’ Artagnan , ” she said , smiling graciously ; “ I thank you for having insisted on seeing me. ” “ I ought to ask your majesty ’ s pardon , but I wished to receive your commands from your own mouth. ” “ Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you ? ” “ With gratitude. ” “ Very well , be here at midnight. ” “ I will not fail. ” “ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , ” continued the queen , “ I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment , but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the first. ” “ Your majesty is free to forget or to remember , as it pleases you ; and I know not what you mean , ” said D ’ Artagnan , bowing .
It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past , and not to anticipate the future .
When the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des Fossoyeurs—that is to say , when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII .
Arrived at the top stair , she turned round , and called out , in a warning tone , to her husband , “ Gaspard , consider well what you are about to do ! ” “ I have both reflected and decided , ” answered he .
If I were a man , that would barely be possible ; but what can a woman do ?
He embraced his weeping wife and daughter , pressed Emmanuel ’ s hand with friendly warmth , and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles .

She draws only fifteen feet .
Chapter LXVII .
“ Thou must add , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere , and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest , then mention my name ! ” Planchet , leading his horse by the bridle , drew near to the gate and rang the bell , and immediately a servant-man with white hair and of erect stature , notwithstanding his age , presented himself .
I will aid you in many ways , but without attaching you to my person .
He was , notwithstanding , anxious to set out ; but his illness becoming more serious , he was forced to stop at Villeroy .
“ We are going to execute your wishes. ” “ May Heaven prosper you ! ” replied the dying man , with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe .
You need , as much as we do , that interior condition of repose which , thanks to the energy of our government , we are about to attain .
Oh , yes ; certainly a speedy , violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies , who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance .
A piece of bread was brought , and Jacopo offered him the gourd .
As she uttered that bon mot , she arose and asked for her carriage .
“ Come , sir , ” said he , addressing Broussel , “ silence that woman and follow me. ” “ Silence me !
“ Now , ” said he , “ I may require to go in one night from Paris to Tréport ; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road , which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours. ” “ Your highness had already expressed that wish , ” said Bertuccio , “ and the horses are ready .
“ Two feet below you ; take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor .
Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him , for the letter will be found upon him , or at his father ’ s , or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon_. ” “ Very good , ” resumed Danglars ; “ now your revenge looks like common sense , for in no way can it revert to yourself , and the matter will thus work its own way ; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing , and write upon it , ‘ To the king ’ s attorney , ’ and that ’ s all settled. ” And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke .
The latter obeyed without reply , and entered the chamber , where he appeared to be expected .
The world calls me beautiful .
At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript , upon the cover of which was written “ Mirame , a Tragedy in Five Acts , ” and raised his head .
Still , though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend , Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess .
D ’ Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword .
The tutor followed them .
In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman , dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate , riding on a tall horse .
The door yielded .
We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for , given , and received ; and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved , when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected .
“ Nevertheless , Raoul , you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy. ” The youth looked pleased .
“ The devil ! ” exclaimed the Gascon , “ ’ tis a dreadful night , my lord .
Now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? —that which we do not understand .
One of the two riders , he who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion .
1.E.3 .
But what could these men , whom I at first took for robbers , want with me , and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here ? ” “ Madame , those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been , for they are the agents of the cardinal ; and as to your husband , Monsieur Bonacieux , he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille. ” “ My husband in the Bastille ! ” cried Mme .
Moreover , he had this advantage , he was master of the count ’ s secret , while the count had no hold on Franz , who had nothing to conceal .
When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men .
The lion bit the hand thus favored , and at the end of twenty-four hours , the bite was mortal .
It was her husband , who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag , and was crying “ Thieves ! ” “ Oh , my God ! ” cried Mme .
By her side I am Spanish , but the family of Morcerf is French , and , I have heard , one of the oldest of the south of France. ” “ Yes , ” replied Monte Cristo “ these blazons prove that .
And whatever might be—considering the violent character of Milady—the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress , she ran back to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could carry her .
“ That person is here , madame , ” said the officer , leaving the entrance open , and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect .
The Avenger .
“ And I , Du Barthois , ” added Porthos .
good Heaven , ” said Planchet , “ what a misfortune !
“ Yes , count , ” returned Julie , “ we may indeed say he has , for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen ; he sent us one of his angels. ” The count ’ s cheeks became scarlet , and he coughed , in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ said he , ‘ you have heard the Comte de Morcerf ’ s defence .
Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required .
No one had the slightest suspicion ; and when next day , taking a fowling-piece , powder , and shot , Dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock , his wish was construed into a love of sport , or a desire for solitude .
It was Mercédès , who , hearing no news of her lover , had come unobserved to inquire after him .
“ A _fleur-de-lis_ , ” said Athos .
“ A prisoner , ” repeated Porthos , quite dejected .
“ Tell me , may I shake hands with you , saying , ‘ Beauchamp , acknowledge you have injured me , and retain my friendship , ’ or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms ? ” “ Albert , ” said Beauchamp , with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man , “ let us first sit down and talk. ” “ Rather , sir , before we sit down , I must demand your answer. ” “ Albert , ” said the journalist , “ these are questions which it is difficult to answer. ” “ I will facilitate it by repeating the question , ‘ Will you , or will you not , retract ? ’ ” “ Morcerf , it is not enough to answer ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ to questions which concern the honor , the social interest , and the life of such a man as Lieutenant-général the Count of Morcerf , peer of France. ” “ What must then be done ? ” 40174m “ What I have done , Albert .
“ Well , in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure , my dear Monsieur Groslow , for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it. ” “ Not without my defending it , ” said Groslow .
No false modesty ; take the best horse you can find .
“ ‘ Your death ? ’ said he ; ‘ oh , no , you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus , after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single time .
Chapter LXXIII .
what a gourmand you are growing ; I haven ’ t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years. ” The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought , but at that moment , as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La Ramee ’ s ideas , Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to him .
Now attach him to our party .
The king ’ s !
“ Has your excellency anything to ask me ? ” said Vampa with a smile .
Thanks for your devotedness , gentlemen .
d ’ Avrigny , M. d ’ Avrigny , ” cried she , in a stifled voice .
Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks , at intervals of some minutes , each one more serious than the former .
All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard .
Without you I was a dead man—thrice dead. ” “ But one recovers , sir , as you perceive , ” replied Raoul , “ and we have but had a little bath. ” “ Oh !
“ You have no idea , my friend , how my bones ache since I came here .
“ My God ! ” he exclaimed , “ thy vengeance is sometimes delayed , but only that it may fall the more effectually. ” Ali looked at his master for further instructions .
“ You came from a country where he must be very much talked of , and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal. ” “ My friend the cardinal ! ” cried Milady , seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed .
“ The devil take this gout ! ” cried Monsieur de Bouillon , evidently ill at ease .
And , with his lackey , he took the road to the governor ’ s country house .
But for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves , how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain !
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates ; the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs .
Twice you have pronounced that word ! ” “ Certainly .
“ Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris ? ” she inquired .
Just as , ordinarily , faces are colored by blood , his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid .
While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need , he caught a glance from Athos .
you know them likewise ?
Thus Bassompierre , who was at once Protestant and Catholic—Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost ; Bassompierre , who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart—in short , Bassompierre , who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle , said , in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself , “ You will see , gentlemen , that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle. ” And Bassompierre was right .
When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family , you can ask him that question. ” The carriage stopped .
His vengeance , therefore , consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin ; he even tried to make some verses on him , but soon gave up the attempt , for Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying , he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose .
“ Where am I ? ” said she .
You tell me of M. Franz d ’ Épinay , your betrothed lover , and you shrink from the idea of being his wife ; but tell me , Valentine , is there no other sorrow in your heart ?
“ Yes , a telegraph .
The Hand of God Chapter 84 .
Two hours thus glided away .
“ Tedesco ! ” answered the cavalier ; “ va bene. ” And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in , he opened it and disappeared behind it , shutting it as he went .
“ One step nearer , ” said Comminges , putting down the sashes , that the interior of the carriage might be well seen , and placing his sword on his prisoner ’ s breast , “ one step nearer , and I kill the prisoner ; my orders were to carry him off alive or dead .
“ I believe so , ” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness .
“ Yes , Count , ” said Milady , in her softest voice , and pressing his hand in her own , “ I am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met .
Begone , begone ! ” At these words she opened the door of the corridor , and pushed D ’ Artagnan out of the room .
Now , besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville , which is next door to the Bell and Bottle , it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night .
Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before , my fears prevented my feeling hunger .
I bought two thirds of the shares of that company ; as you had foreseen , the shares trebled in value , and I picked up a million , from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for pin-money .
An Adventure on the High Road .
I do not know whether I love you or love you not ; but what I know is that I will not be perjured .
And yet , at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts .
Let us return to the object that brings me here. ” “ What , that which brings you home to me ?
He sighed and set to work again .
The horses , excited by pain and emulation , raced over the dark road , in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass , denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon .
He motioned to Valentine to approach .
Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond .
Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take , ’ tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up. ” “ But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north ? ” “ That , ” said Athos , “ would be quite another thing ; and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic. ” “ Which implies that we may die of hunger , ” said Aramis .
Morrel shuddered ; he thought he heard a sob .
How can I tell ?
But he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen ’ s carriage had left the court .
D ’ Artagnan thought this could not last long , and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears .
He had , then , in order not to disturb his habits , accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips .
But all three reflected upon the youth of D ’ Artagnan , and dreaded his inexperience .
Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl ’ s arm , drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat , and said with a paternal smile : “ My child , believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of Providence and the love of Maximilian. ” Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude , and remained as docile as a child .
Tell me , therefore , who are these men who killed the son with despair , and the father with famine ? ” “ Two men jealous of him , sir ; one from love , and the other from ambition , —Fernand and Danglars. ” “ How was this jealousy manifested ?
Chapter XLV .
I have no design upon your count , and you shall have him all to yourself .
It appears that after having challenged M. de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday , he apologized on the ground today. ” “ Impossible , ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ A great poet !
‘ Here , ’ said he , ‘ are dogs who bark and bite at the same time , they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond , Friend Caderousse. ’ “ Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look .
On their part the Musketeers , who had not much to do with the siege , were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life .
“ Oh , you knew that well enough before speaking to me , ” said Andrea , becoming more and more excited .
I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth , ” he added , attempting to smile ; “ I fetched 2,000 francs. ” “ Then these 1,000 francs—— ” said Mercédès , shuddering .
When the two Musketeers had entered ; when the door was closed behind them ; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber , to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food , had recommenced ; when M. de Tréville had three or four times paced in silence , and with a frowning brow , the whole length of his cabinet , passing each time before Porthos and Aramis , who were as upright and silent as if on parade—he stopped all at once full in front of them , and covering them from head to foot with an angry look , “ Do you know what the king said to me , ” cried he , “ and that no longer ago than yesterday evening—do you know , gentlemen ? ” “ No , ” replied the two Musketeers , after a moment ’ s silence , “ no , sir , we do not. ” “ But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us , ” added Aramis , in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow .
“ Now to the point .
“ We shall see , ” said Athos , “ for we shall go to the sittings , I presume. ” “ You will not have long to wait , ” said the landlord ; “ they begin to-morrow. ” “ So , then , they drew up the indictments before the king was taken ? ” “ Of course , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ they began the day he was sold. ” “ And you know , ” said Aramis , “ that it was our friend Mordaunt who made , if not the bargain , at least the overtures. ” “ And you know , ” added D ’ Artagnan , “ that whenever I catch him I will kill him , this Mordaunt. ” “ And I , too , ” exclaimed Porthos .
“ That ’ s a snare , ” said Athos ; “ don ’ t go , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ And yet , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ I think I recognize the writing. ” “ It may be counterfeit , ” said Athos .
Once outside the city , D ’ Artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood .
Inspector , ” continued the governor , “ I can tell you the story as well as he , for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years. ” “ That proves , ” returned the abbé , “ that you are like those of Holy Writ , who having eyes see not , and having ears hear not. ” “ My dear sir , the government is rich and does not want your treasures , ” replied the inspector ; “ keep them until you are liberated. ” The abbé ’ s eyes glistened ; he seized the inspector ’ s hand .
“ Pardon , gentlemen—par— ” murmured the voice , which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds .
“ I am a faithful subject of the king , madame , and all that his Majesty commands I shall do. ” “ Well , it is true ! ” said Anne of Austria ; “ and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully .

Where is Valentine , sir ?
If your daughter had committed only one crime , and I saw her meditating another , I would say ‘ Warn her , punish her , let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent , weeping and praying. ’ If she had committed two crimes , I would say , ‘ Here , M. de Villefort , is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with , —one that has no known antidote , quick as thought , rapid as lightning , mortal as the thunderbolt ; give her that poison , recommending her soul to God , and save your honor and your life , for it is yours she aims at ; and I can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations .

“ I am lost ! ” was his second thought ; and , indeed , for a man in Andrea ’ s situation , an arrest meant the assizes , trial , and death , —death without mercy or delay .
At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so ; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor ; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape , and refused his request .

“ To Saint Peter ’ s first , and then to the Colosseum , ” returned Albert .
“ Gentlemen , ” interrupted Albert , “ I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between M. de Monte Cristo and myself. ” “ Possibly , possibly , ” said Beauchamp immediately ; “ but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism , and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life .

She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist ; she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course .

As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal , Kitty knew nothing about it ; but this time D ’ Artagnan was better informed than she was .

Dantès remained a prisoner , and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII. ’ s throne , or the still more tragic destruction of the empire .

Bonacieux ; and then , when Bonacieux ’ s cries were no longer audible , “ Good ! ” said he , “ that man would henceforward lay down his life for me. ” And the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La Rochelle , which , as we have said , lay open on the desk , tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which , eighteen months later , shut up the port of the besieged city .
“ You are mistaken—I am not the Count of Monte Cristo. ” “ Then who are you ? ” 50261m “ I am he whom you sold and dishonored—I am he whose betrothed you prostituted—I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune—I am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger—I am he whom you also condemned to starvation , and who yet forgives you , because he hopes to be forgiven—I am Edmond Dantès ! ” Danglars uttered a cry , and fell prostrate .

Cocles remained in M. Morrel ’ s service , and a most singular change had taken place in his position ; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier , and sunk to the rank of a servant .

Porthos did the same .
I am happy to see , M. Beauchamp , that you are more sober than he was. ” “ Sir , ” said M. Beauchamp , “ Albert was wrong , I acknowledge , to betray so much anger , and I come , on my own account , to apologize for him .
“ Now , ” said he , “ that suffices—begone ! ” “ Which way ? ” “ The way you came. ” “ You wish me to get out at that window ? ” “ You got in very well. ” “ Oh , you have some design against me , reverend sir. ” “ Idiot !

“ Adieu , Valentine , adieu ! ” said Morrel , bowing .
We should look like the two sons of Aymon , who had lost their brother .
“ Ja ! ” replied the Gascon , determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German tongue .
Although D ’ Artagnan did not at all know the queen , he soon distinguished her voice from the others , at first by a slightly foreign accent , and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words .

Adieu ; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other. ” The abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of Caderousse , opened the door himself , got out and mounted his horse , once more saluted the innkeeper , who kept uttering his loud farewells , and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming .
“ No , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , piqued , “ and thanks to my eyes , I can see what other people can not see. ” Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him , giving way to his anger , “ Monsieur , ” said he , “ you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion. ” “ Chastised , Monsieur ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ the expression is strong. ” “ It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face. ” “ Ah , _pardieu ! _ I know full well that you don ’ t turn your back to yours. ” And the young man , delighted with his joke , went away laughing loudly .

“ Well , ” said the president ; “ your name ? ” “ I can not tell you my name , since I do not know it ; but I know my father ’ s , and can tell it to you. ” A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort ; great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand .
The repast had been ordered by Athos , and the lackey furnished by Porthos .
“ You guess aright , my friend ; this youth is an orphan , deserted by his mother , who left him in the house of a poor country priest .
Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from Tours , we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed , or rather went before , Bazin ; he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou to the Rue de Vaugirard .
Dantès hastened to his dungeon , where he found him standing in the middle of the room , pale as death , his forehead streaming with perspiration , and his hands clenched tightly together .
It was M. de Villefort , and not the prefect , who returned to the house of M. de Villefort .
“ Yes , and at the same time making a hole in the wall. ” The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven ; then leaping down from his bed he went to the window , and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside , but in vain .

I am at home here , and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another ’ s .
I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding , wounded. ” “ In the left side , was it not , and with a knife ? ” interrupted Buckingham .
Now , one evening when D ’ Artagnan , who was in the trenches , was not able to accompany them , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , mounted on their battle steeds , enveloped in their war cloaks , with their hands upon their pistol butts , were returning from a drinking place called the Red Dovecot , which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to Jarrie , following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard , as we have stated , for fear of an ambuscade , when , about a quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau , they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them .
D ’ Artagnan stopped before them , and they stopped before him .
That would compromise the honor of the French army , to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise ; so I have become a gardener , and , consequently , adopted the costume of my calling. ” “ What excessive nonsense you talk , Maximilian ! ” “ Nonsense ?
“ Yours wholly and most affectionately “ Marie de Montbazon .
The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that D ’ Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence .

It remains _here ! _ ” said Porthos , placing his hand on his heart , and pressing it strongly .
The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it , before they had time to cock their muskets .
D ’ Artagnan observed , on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned , a sort of ripe beauty , rather yellow and rather dry , but erect and haughty under her black hood .
Every evening , either in the antechamber , the corridor , or on the stairs , he met the pretty _soubrette_ .
He approached the wall , and tried to climb it ; but the wall had been recently pointed , and D ’ Artagnan could get no hold .

After the two friends had been chatting a few moments , a servant from M. de Tréville entered , bringing a sealed packet .
He then looked at the objects near him .
Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything .
As for Albert , he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him .
M. de Tréville , moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage , sprang toward him .

Hastily raising myself on one arm , I looked around , but all was dark ; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above , for some kind of moisture appeared to fall , drop by drop , upon my forehead , and when I passed my hand across my brow , I felt that it was wet and clammy .

Lips of stone turned to flame , breasts of ice became like heated lava , so that to Franz , yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug , love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture , as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips , and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces .
“ Yes ; speak. ” “ Then , I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king ’ s Musketeers and Guards , and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence ; I should , therefore , be ill received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me. ” “ Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value ? ” asked the cardinal , with a smile of disdain .

“ I ? ” said the novice .
and rally to the old cry of France , ‘ Montjoy and St. Denis ! ’ The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of traitors. ” They mounted—the king on Winter ’ s horse and Winter on that of the king ; then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron , and the king , with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left , at the head of the second .
Everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face , whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb , and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror .

But if he be willing to accept my offers , will you oppose them ? ” “ You well know , Edmond , that I am no longer a reasoning creature ; I have no will , unless it be the will never to decide .
At Eccuis , the same scene was repeated .
“ He will be condemned , will he not ? ” asked Debray of Beauchamp .
Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window , which was without shutters , but had the half-curtains closely drawn .
D ’ Artagnan hits on a Plan .
“ Yes , and that ’ s all settled ; only it will be an infamous shame ; ” and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter .
“ Raoul gives me much uneasiness , ” he said .
“ Did you drink some too , M. Noirtier ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And did you also discover a bitter taste ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Oh , doctor , ” cried Barrois , “ the fit is coming on again .
“ Why , what ails you ? ” asked he of Edmond .
“ That emetic , Villefort—see if it is coming. ” Villefort sprang into the passage , exclaiming , “ The emetic !
I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor. ” “ Well , then , if you did , depend upon it , Fernand picked it up , and either copied it or caused it to be copied ; perhaps , even , he did not take the trouble of recopying it .
The Swiss , with an air of stupefaction , looked at the hostess , who turned pale .
As quick as thought , he tore open the letter , in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do , or rather , what he was doing .
His person had undergone a change , analogous to the change in his dress ; his figure had grown rotund and , as it were , canonical .
The cardinal ’ s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence .
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France ? ” “ I am , sir , ” said the king , much agitated ; “ and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques .
“ And why revenge ? ” he asked .
You are included in the conscription , Fernand , and are only at liberty on sufferance , liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms .
On the left was an old abandoned mill , with its motionless wings , from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill , periodical , and monotonous cry .
And he turned up two cards as usual , a king for D ’ Artagnan and an ace for himself .
Yes , in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect .
“ Repeat your father ’ s name , ” said the president .
The inspector kept his word with Dantès ; he examined the register , and found the following note concerning him : _Edmond Dantès : _ Violent Bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from Elba .
“ Well , well , ” said one , “ the madman has gone to look after his treasure .
He began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes , and won the heart of the gardener .
Finally he slept .
At that moment he cut it .
Dantès had exhausted all human resources , and he then turned to God .
“ My son ! ” he exclaimed suddenly , “ where is my son ? —Edward , Edward ! ” and he rushed out of the room , still crying , “ Edward , Edward ! ” The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up .
There will be eleven crowns gained. ” It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in D ’ Artagnan ’ s purse .
“ Listen , ” said he ; “ I have not the strength of mind you have , or rather that which you would not have , if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned. ” The doctor turned pale .
13 , ” murmured he , growing still paler .
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work , in order to have , if wanted , the right of using reprisals ; but we must not believe everything ministers say , nor everything their enemies say .
Neither had any .
Meanwhile , by a cleft between two walls of rock , following a path worn by a torrent , and which , in all human probability , human foot had never before trod , Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed .
My vocation commands me ; it carries me away. ” D ’ Artagnan smiled , but made no answer .
he was very much inclined to do so , the contemptible fellow .
Think of that , Valentine !
“ May I , at least , return ? ” asked Morrel .
D ’ Artagnan !
It is not a man , then , but some angel that leaves us , and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good. ” “ Say not so , ” quickly returned Monte Cristo— “ say not so , my friends ; angels never err , celestial beings remain where they wish to be .
He had not done so for ten years before .
Four or five cloaks had already been lifted , with a dexterity without parallel , and not one of the victims had dared to say a word , when some fool of a fellow , less patient than the others , took it into his head to cry out , ‘ Guard ! ’ and drew upon us a patrol of archers .
The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him , the shadow that haunted him by day and night .
“ Oh , yes , I assure you , count , they want nothing that can render them happy ; they are young and cheerful , they are tenderly attached to each other , and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as Rothschild. ” “ Five-and-twenty thousand francs is not a large sum , however , ” replied Monte Cristo , with a tone so sweet and gentle , that it went to Maximilian ’ s heart like the voice of a father ; “ but they will not be content with that .
When left alone with Bernouin , Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought .
“ It was not the one she wished for most , but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her .

D ’ Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword ; but Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing , and rushing blindly upon him , absolutely spitted himself upon D ’ Artagnan ’ s sword .
He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France , bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians ; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles , a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia .
We will see , gentlemen , we will see .
“ Yes , count , and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to accept my excuses. ” “ What is it ? ” “ Be so good as to give me up your sword , count. ” Athos smiled and opened the window .
In addition to this , after a half hour ’ s conversation D ’ Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot ; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head .
“ ‘ Your mode of life as a smuggler , ’ said he to me one day , ‘ will be the ruin of you ; if you get out , don ’ t take it up again. ’ “ ‘ But how , ’ inquired I , ‘ am I to maintain myself and my poor sister ? ’ “ ‘ A person , whose confessor I am , ’ replied he , ‘ and who entertains a high regard for me , applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant .
D ’ Artagnan placed the ring on his finger , and again waited ; it was evident that all was not yet over .
“ I waited for him until this hour , ” replied Franz .
“ Well , young man , ” said he , “ we appear to pass rather gay nights !
Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops , who were entering , pele-mele , the intrenchments with the fugitives .
she has just left me , and she complained of being indisposed , but I did not think seriously of it. ” The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother , approached Valentine and took her hand .
“ Just so , ” muttered Comminges , looking after Mazarin .
“ You have one at heart , Aramis , one deeper and more painful—a wound made by a woman. ” The eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself .
I charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself , my dearest sweetheart. ” The letter bore the signature , not of “ Charles , King , ” but of “ Charles—still king. ” “ And let him be no longer king , ” cried the queen .
“ Farewell , ” said Charles , “ farewell , my children .
Chapter XXXVIII .
Porthos is in Picardy. ” Then aloud : “ And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon ? ” “ To which he adds that of Bracieux , an estate which has been a barony , by my troth. ” “ So that Porthos will be a baron. ” “ I don ’ t doubt it .
“ To Cours la Reine ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan to the coachman ; then turning to Mazarin he said , “ Now , my lord , you can say five paters and five aves , in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance .
Since your eminence has come so far , come a few steps further ; conduct us , my lord , to the wall. ” “ Be it so , ” replied the cardinal ; and walking in a straight line he went to the wall , at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant .
Ah !
I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you .
One day , however , an emissary of the cardinal ’ s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often .
This adjoins the lower part of the governor ’ s apartments , and were we to work our way through , we should only get into some lock-up cellars , where we must necessarily be recaptured .
As to the sailors of the _Pharaon_ , they must have found snug berths elsewhere , for they also had disappeared .
In one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp , Debray , and Château-Renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness .
Ah !
“ These gentlemen are with me , ” said Winter .
“ Wait , ” he continued , renewing his fruitless search ; “ it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of Henry IV .
You know , madame , how suddenly I snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched ? ” “ Is it then so terrible a poison ? ” “ Oh , no !

On the twenty-eighth of October , 1628 , the capitulation was signed .
The result was , that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals , and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation , and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators .
But perhaps you have never loved ! ” “ Child ! ” replied the count .
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin , who was running breathlessly .
In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries , two reports , fearfully distinct , followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all , froze me with terror .
Planchet , by way of dessert , would have liked to hear the conversation ; but the citizen declared to D ’ Artagnan that , what he had to say being important and confidential , he desired to be left alone with him .
What story can I invent ?
He asked what was going on .
In the meantime please to sit down , monsieur , and I will fetch you some refreshment. ’ “ The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince .
Allow me , then , sire , to intercede for her with your Majesty. ” “ Let her humble herself , then , and come to me first. ” “ On the contrary , sire , set the example .
Madame de Lannoy , whom , according to your Majesty ’ s command , I have frequently interrogated , told me this morning that the night before last her Majesty sat up very late , that this morning she wept much , and that she was writing all day. ” “ That ’ s it ! ” cried the king ; “ to him , no doubt .
I pardon you for the death of poor Felton ; I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person .
Be one or the other , but not both , ” replied Porthos .
Well , let us pledge the ring , but upon one condition. ” “ What ? ” “ That there shall be five hundred crowns for you , and five hundred crowns for me. ” “ Don ’ t dream it , Athos .
D ’ Artagnan has conquered her—her , that invincible power of evil .
Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs , and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card .
I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair .
“ A nobleman retired from service , is he not ? ” “ Yes. ” “ And who had a lackey named Grimaud ? ” persisted Planchet , who had prudently considered that he couldn ’ t have too much information .
“ Come hither , ” said Mazarin in his softest voice ; “ I have an order to give you. ” D ’ Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase , soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out .
It is nearly eight o ’ clock , and at nine I expect a visit .
She had fled with him from her convent. ” “ With your brother ? ” “ Yes , my brother was her first lover , and she caused his death .
Signor Luigi , ” continued Albert , “ is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency ? ” “ None , sir , ” replied the bandit , “ you are as free as air. ” “ Well , then , a happy and merry life to you .
But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal , so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England , had not succeeded in arresting him on the road .
“ You understand me perfectly , on the contrary , ” said Danglars : “ but , if you will persist , I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs upon the Spanish loan. ” “ And pray , ” asked the baroness , “ am I responsible for this loss ? ” “ Why not ? ” “ Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs ? ” “ Certainly it is not mine. ” “ Once for all , sir , ” replied the baroness sharply , “ I tell you I will not hear cash named ; it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband. ” “ Oh , I can well believe that , for neither of them was worth a penny. ” “ The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank , which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night ; that noise of jingling crowns , which are constantly being counted and re-counted , is odious to me .
“ Where is the prisoner ? ” said a voice .
Monsieur passed along the front of the line ; then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments , M. Dessessart , captain of the Guards , as well as the others .
He has two means of extricating me from this dilemma , —the one by a mysterious escape , managed through bribery ; the other by buying off my judges with gold .

By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up , but only to sink down again immediately , and to fall into the arms of my persecutor. ” “ Tell me who this man was ! ” cried the young officer .
“ But , ” said D ’ Artagnan , in the ear of Athos , “ you are going to get us all killed without mercy. ” “ We are much more likely to be killed , ” said Athos , “ if we do not go. ” “ My faith , gentlemen , ” said Porthos , turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache , “ that ’ s a fair bet , I hope. ” “ I take it , ” said M. de Busigny ; “ so let us fix the stake. ” “ You are four gentlemen , ” said Athos , “ and we are four ; an unlimited dinner for eight .
There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair ; but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition—— ” “ Real ? ” interrupted the count , smiling .
Besides , she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything .
“ A great man in every country , M. Debray , ” said Château-Renaud .
Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis , called Olivain , the lackey who had followed him from Blois , and made him pack the valise under his own eyes , watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign .
And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably , not toward London , where D ’ Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going , but to Durham , whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne , and accompany us to the royalist camp , on this side of the Tyne , near Newcastle .
“ ‘ I thought you were at Smyrna. ’ — ‘ I was ; but am now back again. ’ “ ‘ And where is the dear boy , our little Edmond ? ’ “ ‘ Why , with his father , no doubt , ’ replied Danglars .
Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person ; like her sister the queen , she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen ; she resolved , therefore , to seek hospitality of the priest. ” Athos paused .
Athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow ; a flash kindled in his eyes , and a bitter smile passed over his lips , then , like his comrades , he sank again into reverie .
This time , however , due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape .
However , those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred , it was not to the vessel herself , for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled , the anchor a-cockbill , the jib-boom guys already eased off , and standing by the side of the pilot , who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port , was a young man , who , with activity and vigilant eye , watched every motion of the ship , and repeated each direction of the pilot .
“ What do you ask of me ? ” said he , — “ your son ’ s life ?
At each cross-path was an orchestra , and tables spread with refreshments ; the guests stopped , formed quadrilles , and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased .
He found her in a charming humor .
What we are going to say does not concern your majesty. ” The king , smiling , turned a few steps back .
D ’ Artagnan came the next day to Milady ’ s , and finding her in a very ill-humor , had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes that provoked her thus .
No , he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket , and took from it a paper folded in four , and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential , he said : “ Good !
D ’ Artagnan entered behind him .
Take advantage of all , and live happily and long .
“ Here is the story , monseigneur , ” resumed the trembling host ; “ for I now recollect you .
Happiness comes to meet him , does it not , Monsieur Bonacieux ? ” Bonacieux became as pale as death , and grinned a ghastly smile .
Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt .
Then offer him double that sum ; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital. ” “ Is your excellency really in earnest ? ” inquired the steward .
absurd !
Why , this Count of Monte Cristo must be a nabob ? ” “ Indeed I do not know what he is ; he has three unlimited credits—one on me , one on Rothschild , one on Lafitte ; and , you see , ” he added carelessly , “ he has given me the preference , by leaving a balance of 100,000 francs. ” M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration .
God sends me this , and I hail it joyfully ! ” “ How strong and courageous you are ! ” said the fair , frail girl to her brunette companion .
Although a Christian , may God forgive me , I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father .
The duke meanwhile recovered his self-control .
This beverage required a good half-hour to prepare .
Then I admit my patience failed me ; I drew my sword in my turn , and as he came back to the charge , I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me , he let it pass through his body .

The day passed away as rapidly as an hour .

They talk of making him an ambassador. ” 30303m “ And what are his claims to the peerage ? ” “ He has composed two or three comic operas , written four or five articles in the _Siècle_ , and voted five or six years on the ministerial side. ” “ Bravo , viscount , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling ; “ you are a delightful _cicerone_ .
“ Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life , like those ancient Romans , who when condemned by Nero , their emperor and heir , sat down at a table covered with flowers , and gently glided into death , amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses ? ” Morrel smiled .
But tell me all about it ? ” “ Why do you wish to know ? ” asked Cavalcanti .
Then , after dinner , on the pretext of business , he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living ; and the father and son , previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually , were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker ’ s servants , so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon .
Let us see what Porthos has found for supper. ” And thanking the captain , he regained the state cabin , where his friends were .

Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from his horse , not because he was severely wounded , but not being able to see the wound , he judged it to be more serious than it really was .
For my part I am going to pay a second visit to this woman , who I fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life , and I have received orders to watch her. ” “ Good ! ” murmured Milady ; “ the austere Puritan lies. ” As to the soldier , he only smiled .
woe is me !
One is that of Edmond Dantès , lost to me long , long since .
With discretion D ’ Artagnan remained behind ; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed the threshold , he turned round , and seeing the hesitation of the young man , “ Come in ! ” cried he , “ and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her Majesty ’ s presence , tell her what you have seen. ” Encouraged by this invitation , D ’ Artagnan followed the duke , who closed the door after them .
Tell me , now , can you deny all this ? ” “ And who told you this fine story , sire ? ” asked Tréville , quietly .
“ Yes , if it is not any serious affair , otherwise I can not answer as to what I may do myself. ” “ Be prudent , in any event , ” said the countess .
He did not , however , lose sight of Milady , and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face .
I am in a hurry to begin .
Chapter III .
Bonacieux re-entered .
I found the tenant .
“ And who is the assassin ; ” they asked together .
The darkness lasted two hours longer ; then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds , until at length it revealed the objects in the room .
D ’ Artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt ; then both mounted and departed quietly .
An entire wing of the villa was burnt down ; but what of that , as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured ?
“ Well , that has happened , friend Porthos .
Consent , then , I beg you , madame , to write at the bottom of this schedule , which has been drawn up by Mazarin , as you see : “ ‘ I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Parisians. ’ ” Anne was caught , she could not draw back—she signed ; but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep .
He is a worthy , honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody .
“ At what time ? ” “ Six o ’ clock. ” “ Where ? ” “ At Saint Mande. ” “ Who told you ? ” “ The Count de Rochefort. ” Some one drew near .
Stop !
He passed along the same corridor as before , crossed one court , then a second side of a building ; at length , at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback .
“ Ah , my dear fellow , ” said he to Franz ; “ you did not see ? ” “ What ? ” “ There , —that calash filled with Roman peasants. ” “ No. ” “ Well , I am convinced they are all charming women. ” “ How unfortunate that you were masked , Albert , ” said Franz ; “ here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments. ” “ Oh , ” replied he , half laughing , half serious ; “ I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other. ” But , in spite of Albert ’ s hope , the day passed unmarked by any incident , excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman peasants .
“ Listen , ” said M. de Tréville ; “ shall I give you counsel , good counsel , the counsel of a friend ? ” “ You will do me honor , monsieur , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ No , God forbid , ” said the cardinal ; “ only , at what hour was he with you ? ” “ Oh , as to that I can speak positively , your Eminence ; for as he came in I remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock , although I had believed it to be later. ” “ At what hour did he leave your hôtel ? ” “ At half past ten—an hour after the event. ” “ Well , ” replied the cardinal , who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of Tréville , and who felt that the victory was escaping him , “ well , but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs. ” “ Is one friend forbidden to visit another , or a Musketeer of my company to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart ’ s company ? ” “ Yes , when the house where he fraternizes is suspected. ” “ That house is suspected , Tréville , ” said the king ; “ perhaps you did not know it ? ” “ Indeed , sire , I did not .
“ The result was that the two men communicated with one another ; how long they did so , nobody knows .
“ Read the address. ” “ Monsieur El Comte de Wardes. ” The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous Gascon .

the tie is even more direct , it seems to me. ” “ Oh , madame , ” said Villefort , deeply affected , in spite of himself , “ do not yield to those gloomy thoughts ; you will long live with us , happy , loved , and honored , and we will make you forget—— ” “ Never , never , never , ” said the marchioness .
Milady knew she might be watched , so she continued her prayers to the end ; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step , and seemed to listen .

“ Gentlemen , ” said Athos , “ she is alone within half a league of us , in the direction of the river. ” “ That ’ s well , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
Oh , ungrateful girl that I am , ” cried Valentine , sobbing , “ I will give up all , even my dear old grandfather , whom I had nearly forgotten. ” “ No , ” said Maximilian , “ you shall not leave him .
You cry very loud , you end by doing nothing ; you talk of flying—— ” Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen ’ s hand led her to the window .

Tell me what I am to do for this. ” “ A very easy thing , if your horse isn ’ t tired. ” “ I tell you he ’ ll go like the wind , —only tell me which way to drive. ” “ Towards the Louvres. ” “ Ah , I know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there. ” “ Exactly so ; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends , with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at Chapelle-en-Serval .

The count filled one glass , but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid .

“ ‘ In the first place , ’ said he , ‘ I wish my lackey placed with me , fully armed. ’ We hastened to obey this order ; for you will please to understand , monsieur , we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire .
The queen was ignorant where the mercer ’ s young wife was , but had promised to have her sought for ; but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure D ’ Artagnan .
The boat sailed on all day and all night , and next morning , when the sun rose , they had lost sight of Monte Cristo .
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army , a separate command had to be given to each .
D ’ Artagnan remained for a moment motionless , asking himself where he could be ; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber , together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture , the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined , and the word “ Majesty ” several times repeated , indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen ’ s apartment .
Have you , by any chance , been in the Bastile ? ” “ No , madame , I have not ; but very likely I am on the road to it. ” “ Ah !
“ Will you eat any of these beans , Cousin Porthos ? ” said Mme .
“ Privately ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , I will remain with you. ” At this moment Villefort returned , followed by the lady ’ s maid ; and after her came Madame de Villefort .

Chapter XXXV .
“ Ah !
They traced her to Châlons , and there they lost her. ” “ They lost her ? ” “ Yes , forever. ” Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh , a tear , or a shriek for every detail .

The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing. ” It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply ; not only was he the elder , but he had been presented to the prince by his father .
“ I think I understand his reason , ” said Morrel .
Quick , quick !
Broussel had been conducted out of Paris without further resistance , and was at this time in the prison of Saint Germain ; while Blancmesnil , who was arrested at the same time , but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise , was safe in the Castle of Vincennes .
The visitor was about fifty-two years of age , dressed in one of the green surtouts , ornamented with black frogs , which have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe .
Ah , ah !
“ And now , ” said Athos , “ it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen , but we must map up our campaign .
“ And when is the wedding to be ? ” he asked .
Milady then perceived , with terror , that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed .
The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded .
Do you know ? ” “ She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us. ” 50105m “ Who is he ? ” “ Whom do you mean ? ” “ The gentleman who receives us ?
Chapter 38 .
The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg , but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris had become rivers , and the open places lakes ; after the great rains which fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital .
“ When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it , you will further say to him : _Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham , for they wish to assassinate him_ .
The knife fell to the ground .
“ Look , ” said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , “ here is in this cup some syrup of violets , and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook .
You are perhaps a tulip fancier ? ” “ My dear friend , if I am , you must not laugh at me for being so .
Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time .
The Law We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d ’ Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight ; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs .
the devil take this gout ! ” Athos and Aramis took their leave , but even in the ante-chamber they could still hear the duke ’ s cries ; he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned .
Aramis had discovered the idea , _the lackeys_ .
Poor lad !
Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash .
About fifty paces off , another man , also appareled as a cavalier , was talking to a Scotch sentinel , and , though a foreigner , he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire dialect .
“ Ah , ah ! ” cried one of the Guards , “ will you persist in saying , most discreet Aramis , that you are not on good terms with Madame de Bois-Tracy , when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs ? ” Aramis darted at D ’ Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy .
When they met they looked desolately at one another , as much as to say , “ Have you found anything ? ” However , as Porthos had first found an idea , and had thought of it earnestly afterward , he was the first to act .
“ The penalty of death , I greatly fear ; they have gone too far for him to pardon them , and there is nothing left to them but one thing , and that is to kill him .
But what cared I for delays or difficulties , Valentine , as long as you confessed that you loved me , and took pity on me ?
“ Ah , ” said he , “ I hear a human voice. ” Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years ; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door , a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron .
Debray paused a moment before reading , as if trying to guess its contents , or perhaps while making up his mind how to act , whatever it might contain .
“ Ah , what a dreadful thing , ” said the young musician ; “ who would have suspected it ?
Mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him .
“ No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me ; I only supposed it must be seven or eight o ’ clock in the evening , for it was in the month of October and it was quite dark .
what are his means of existence ?
To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense .
Porthos had not only been well received by the company , but he was moreover looked on with great admiration .
A black satin stock , fresh from the maker ’ s hands , gray moustaches , a bold eye , a major ’ s uniform , ornamented with three medals and five crosses—in fact , the thorough bearing of an old soldier—such was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti , that tender father with whom we are already acquainted .
It is magnetism , she says , and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen , she assures me .
Monsieur de Mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to General Cromwell , instead of King Charles , which would have been a disgrace , rebounding from us to him , and from him to your majesty—a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son .
“ Very good , ” said Groslow , and opened the door of the room .
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat , and he redoubled his exertions , increasing rapidly his distance from the château , but exhausting his strength .
A few soldiers , commanded by a sergeant , drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse .
That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini ’ s rear when he fell .
“ Grimaud ! ” he cried ; “ remain ; I wish it. ” “ Then , ” replied Grimaud , “ you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed. ” He saluted and made a movement to depart .
The matter was no longer doubtful .
The Suicide Chapter 93 .
An unexpected incident , in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s , in which he nearly fell a victim , deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort. ” “ Indeed ? ” said M. Danglars , in the same tone in which he would have said , “ Oh , well , what do I care ? ” “ As a matter of fact , ” said Monte Cristo , approaching , “ I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence. ” “ What , you , count ? ” said Madame Danglars , signing ; “ if you are , take care , for I shall never forgive you. ” Andrea pricked up his ears .
When your turn comes , I shall have the honor to inform you of it .
Once in Paris , I shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman ! ” “ Well , you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis .
“ My dear Athos , ” cried Aramis , “ I think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson—God forgive me ! ” “ Wait a little , Aramis ; it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor. ” “ Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace , ” said Aramis .
Lemonade was a very bad thing for him. ” “ Grandpapa ’ s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side ; poor Barrois was very thirsty , and was thankful to drink anything he could find. ” Madame de Villefort started .
The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room .
This being understood , let us proceed with our history .
The king signed the order for release , and Tréville carried it away without delay .
Major Cavalcanti Chapter 56 .
Accustomed , however , as he was to the work , he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary , so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words , “ Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine ’ s room. ” Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois ’ s situation , and in Noirtier ’ s name gave that order .
Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth , and swallowed it .
‘ Penelon , ’ said the captain , ‘ I think we are sinking , give me the helm , and go down into the hold. ’ I gave him the helm , and descended ; there was already three feet of water .
“ Are you satisfied now ? ” inquired Valentine .
The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench .
“ To arms ! ” cried Grimaud .
Chapter XLV .
“ My mother thought me dead ; she is not guilty .
I have fought too long ; they have sold me , they shall give me up , and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads. ” “ Sire , ” said Athos , “ perhaps a king should act thus , but not a husband and a father .
“ Never mind .
The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth .
“ My God !
“ And you shall be alone , ” replied the young man .
The heights of Pindus towered above us ; the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake , and the immense masses of black vegetation which , viewed in the distance , gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks , were in reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles .
So throwing himself back in his armchair , he said , with an arrogant and purse-proud air : “ Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes ; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars , however limited , are still equal to meeting the largest demands ; and were you even to require a million—— ” “ I beg your pardon , ” interposed Monte Cristo .
But , we must say , at the present moment D ’ Artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested .
The count , by any opening from the bedroom , or by concealing himself in the dressing-room , would be able to defend his property himself .
ha ! ” laughed the apparition , “ every gentleman seems to have the same fancy , for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad , well mounted like you , as tall as you and of about your age , halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here , and dined here , with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor , upon a pie , of which they haven ’ t left a mouthful , and two bottles of Macon wine , of which they haven ’ t left a drop , but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left , and if your worship will but give your orders—— ” “ No , friend , ” replied Raoul , smiling , “ I am obliged to you , but at this moment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked—only I shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good ; upon these conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle , and for the ink the price of the pie. ” “ Very well , sir , ” said the host , “ I ’ ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant , and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain. ” “ Do as you like , ” said Raoul , who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society , who , when there were robbers on the highroads , were connected with them , and who , since highwaymen no longer exist , have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place .
“ From pure zeal ? ” resumed Mazarin , with his artful smile ; “ from pure zeal and devotion then ? ” “ My lord has , perhaps , no faith in those words ? ” said D ’ Artagnan .
“ Believe me , dear Albert , ” he said , with all the emotion he was capable of feeling , — “ believe me , I feel deeply for your misfortunes , and if in any way I can serve you , I am yours. ” “ Thank you , sir , ” said Albert , smiling .
“ You see , ” said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to Faria , “ that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you .
I see nothing but faces a yard broad ; in short , it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb , and that the trees , instead of leaves and flowers , are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days. ” “ As for me , ” said Planchet , “ I seem to smell , from this place , even , a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat , and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge , hailing our approach .
Meantime , you see that the lackeys saddle the horses. ” “ I have no horse , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ but that is of no consequence , I can take one of Monsieur de Tréville ’ s. ” “ That is not worth while , ” said Aramis , “ you can have one of mine. ” “ One of yours !

Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions , and had simply thrown it in a corner .
Ali is my slave , and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me. ” “ Nay , ” interposed Madame de Villefort , on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression , “ nay , but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own. ” “ His life , madame , belongs not to him ; it is mine , in return for my having myself saved him from death. ” Madame de Villefort made no further reply ; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who , from the first instant she saw him , had made so powerful an impression on her .
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt , but which , however , was nothing but observation , or rather the wish to fascinate .
Well , before you leave , tell him all ; his consent would be your justification in God ’ s sight .
Mousqueton trembled in all his members .
Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind .
“ How do you mean ? ” said Valentine , looking anxiously around .
“ Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones , ” replied the Englishman .
This was divided into three compartments—one which was covered by the floor of that room in which Athos , Porthos and Aramis were to pass the night ; the second was to serve as the sleeping-room for the servants , the third , under the prow of the ship , was under the temporary cabin in which Mordaunt was concealed .
“ I will continue , then , ” resumed Aramis .
So long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol , whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here .
He rose , and preceded by the host wringing his hands , and followed by Planchet with his musketoon ready for use , he approached the scene of action .
“ Eh ? ” he said to the postilion , “ eh , _mio caro ? _ ” This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti .
He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast , and without uttering a word he gave her the letter .
“ Then I went out of the house ; I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready .
“ What would be the use of carrying so much more weight ? ” was the reply , “ I can do that when we get there. ” “ Yes , you ’ re right , ” replied the companion .
“ Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you , since for the moment you have no master but God ? ” “ It is possible. ” “ Have you , my dear Aramis , thought sometimes of those happy , happy , happy days of youth we passed laughing , drinking , and fighting each other for play ? ” “ Certainly , and more than once regretted them ; it was indeed a glorious time. ” “ Well , those splendidly wild days may chance to come again ; I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you , who were the very soul of our society. ” Aramis bowed , rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment .
They withdrew to a private house , and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety , they occupied but one room and provided an exit , which might be useful in case of an attack .
what design can I have ? ” “ Why , then , not let me out by the door ? ” “ What would be the advantage of waking the porter ? ” “ Ah , reverend sir , tell me , do you wish me dead ? ” “ I wish what God wills. ” “ But swear that you will not strike me as I go down. ” “ Cowardly fool ! ” “ What do you intend doing with me ? ” “ I ask you what can I do ?
Anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition. ” “ Pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while Aramis and Porthos caracole on their steeds. ” “ Aramis !
My mother was a Christian , and she prayed .
“ Never ! ” “ Sire , I entreat you to do so. ” “ Besides , in what manner can I make advances first ? ” “ By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her. ” “ What is that ? ” “ Give a ball ; you know how much the queen loves dancing .
“ Yes ; but I am expecting some one , a friend of Athos. ” “ A friend ! ” exclaimed the count .
I called the valet , I stopped the postilion , I spoke to M. de Saint-Méran , I applied my smelling-salts ; but all was over , and I arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse. ” Villefort stood with his mouth half open , quite stupefied .
“ I regret now , ” said he , “ having helped you in your late inquiries , or having given you the information I did. ” “ Why so ? ” inquired Dantès .
Madame Danglars , with tearless eyes , but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion , placed the bank-notes in her bag , put the certificate and check into her pocket-book , and then , standing pale and mute , awaited one kind word of consolation .
However , ” he added , turning to Porthos , “ I should not regret dying , sir , were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to you. ” “ Mouston , ” replied Porthos , much affected , “ should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm. ” “ And you should call it ‘ Devotion , ’ ” added Aramis ; “ the vineyard of self-sacrifice , to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master. ” “ Chevalier , ” said D ’ Artagnan , laughing , “ you could eat a piece of Mouston , couldn ’ t you , especially after two or three days of fasting ? ” “ Oh , no , ” replied Aramis , “ I should much prefer Blaisois ; we haven ’ t known him so long. ” One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place , the servants , with the exception of Grimaud , were not silent .
Julie returned , holding the silken purse in her hands , while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks , like dewdrops on the rose .
On the next day Mathieu Molé , the chief president , whose courage at this crisis , says the Cardinal de Retz , was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de Condé—in other words , of the two men who were considered the bravest in France—had been attacked in his turn .

Monsieur de Rochefort , ” said Gondy , laughing , “ are you a boy to play with firearms ? ” Rochefort recognized the voice .
“ Listen , ” replied Felton , in a low voice .
“ Good-evening , M. Beauchamp , ” said Monte Cristo , as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening ; “ be seated. ” Beauchamp bowed , and , sitting down , “ Sir , ” said he , “ I just now accompanied M. de Morcerf , as you saw. ” “ And that means , ” replied Monte Cristo , laughing , “ that you had , probably , just dined together .
Who knows but that , in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father , he may not persecute me by every means in his power ?
“ Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a pitiful atom , with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions. ” Monte Cristo smiled .
The gig was already lowered , and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain .
“ I did not expect to see you again , ” said he feebly , to Dantès .
Where he was no one knew .
Let Monsieur Grimaud go in , Monsieur Mouston. ” “ I could go in as well as Grimaud , ” said Mousqueton , a little piqued .
I will send for M. Deschamps ; we will read and sign the contract before we separate , and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate , where we will rejoin them in a week. ” “ Sir , ” said Franz , “ I have one request to make. ” “ What is it ? ” “ I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud to be present at this signature ; you know they are my witnesses. ” “ Half an hour will suffice to apprise them ; will you go for them yourself , or shall you send ? ” “ I prefer going , sir. ” “ I shall expect you , then , in half an hour , baron , and Valentine will be ready. ” Franz bowed and left the room .
In truth , that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer , was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed , as we have observed , more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature—from the corridors deserted by courtiers , and courts crowded with guards—from that spirit of bitter ridicule , which , arising from the streets below , penetrated through the very casements of the room , which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister ; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing—let off , happily , without other end or aim , except to show to the guards , the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais Royal , that the people were possessed of arms .
For my part , I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them , in spite of all the Mazarins in the world. ” “ You would be right , Porthos , but for one thing , which may change the current of your ideas ; and that is , that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger , it is ourselves ; it is not to abandon them that we have separated , but to avoid compromising them. ” “ Really ? ” said Porthos , opening his eyes in astonishment .
“ Valentine , ” repeated the same voice .
My money boxes are my Pactolus , as , I think , M. Demoustier says , and I will not retard its course , or disturb its calm .
what is he himself ? ” asked Madame Henrietta .
Mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the Pont Neuf , on account of the ceremonial of the day , and that they would soon withdraw .
The count ’ s tutor , a man of the world and a bon vivant , up to his eyes in learning , as his pupil described him , often recalled the profound erudition , the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul ; but as regarded grace , delicacy , and nobility of external appearance , no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte de la Fere .
“ Ah , I have been running very fast , mademoiselle , but I must do M. Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster. ” Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter , on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass .
The Hôtel de la Trémouille ! ” At these cries , all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions , who on their side cried aloud , “ To the rescue , Musketeers ! ” This cry was generally heeded ; for the Musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal , and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his Eminence .
“ What is it ? ” asked the baroness .
Nevertheless , rapid as the movement had been , D ’ Artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man .

Rueil was crowded with advocates , presidents and councillors , who came from the Parisians , and , on the side of the court , with officers and guards ; it was therefore easy , in the midst of this confusion , to remain as unobserved as any one might wish ; besides , the conferences implied a truce , and to arrest two gentlemen , even Frondeurs , at this time , would have been an attack on the rights of the people .
“ Ho !
Because you think I am drunk ?
In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count. ” “ You have , doubtless , heard the adventures of M. Zaccone ’ s youth ? ” “ The father ’ s ? ” “ No , the son ’ s. ” “ I know nothing certain ; at that period of his life , I lost sight of my young comrade. ” “ Was he in the wars ? ” “ I think he entered the service. ” “ In what branch ? ” “ In the navy. ” “ Are you not his confessor ? ” “ No , sir ; I believe he is a Lutheran. ” “ A Lutheran ? ” “ I say , I believe such is the case , I do not affirm it ; besides , liberty of conscience is established in France. ” “ Doubtless , and we are not now inquiring into his creed , but his actions ; in the name of the prefect of police , I ask you what you know of him .
A single portrait , signed by Léopold Robert , shone in its carved and gilded frame .
I am mistaken ? ” “ Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere , but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him. ” “ No , no , no , ” said Comminges , who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were , “ I clearly understood what the cardinal said to me .
Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” said the count ; “ I received a letter from him yesterday , but I do not think the hour was mentioned. ” “ Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety. ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you are fortunate , M. Cavalcanti ; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting , and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl. ” “ Yes , indeed she is , ” replied Cavalcanti , in a very modest tone .
He , no doubt , thought that prisoners who died in the Château d ’ If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground , and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell , took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse , and awaited the moment of interment. ” “ It was a bold step , and one that showed some courage , ” remarked the Englishman .

Pray tell me what you think , baron , for I feel uneasy , I can assure you , having some considerable property in their hands. ” “ Thomson & French are perfectly solvent , ” replied Danglars , with an almost mocking smile ; “ but the word _unlimited_ , in financial affairs , is so extremely vague. ” “ Is , in fact , unlimited , ” said Monte Cristo .
As Villefort drew near , she advanced and stood before him .
Without appearing to have heard the dialogue , of which she had not lost a word , she began again , giving to her voice all the charm , all the power , all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it : “ For all my tears , my cares , My exile , and my chains , I have my youth , my prayers , And God , who counts my pains. ” Her voice , of immense power and sublime expression , gave to the rude , unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren , and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination .
You have seven martlets on your arms ; give three to your wife , and you will still have four ; that is one more than M. de Guise had , who so nearly became King of France , and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany. ” “ On my word , I think you are right , Lucien , ” said Albert absently .
But the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies .
“ Give us a light , ” said the other bearer , “ or I shall never find what I am looking for. ” The man with the torch complied , although not asked in the most polite terms .

But having sinned myself , —it may be more deeply than others , —I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my fellow-creatures , and found out their weaknesses .

He freed his weapon , made a lunge , and touched his adversary on the shoulder .
Yesterday ’ s affair must have shaken him a little ; his voyage would upset him quite. ” Planchet was sent for , and instructions were given him .
It was a very simple , natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation .

I enclose a draft for 5,000 livres , payable on M. Ferrea , banker at Nice , and also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo , whom I have directed to supply all your wants .
His first care was to see what course they were taking .
Dantès , perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father , responded by a look of grateful pleasure ; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond .
Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden ? ” “ I don ’ t find a good musket , twelve cartridges , and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy. ” “ Well , ” replied Athos , “ have you not heard what D ’ Artagnan said ? ” “ What did he say ? ” demanded Porthos .
The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the moment when the count , leaning over a large table , was tracing on a map the route from St. Petersburg to China .

Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly , he replied : “ They ?

Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear , and an inkstand in place of a heart .
This is what had taken place : We have seen that it was not of his own free will , but , on the contrary , very reluctantly , that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner .
I like men of head and heart .
“ Wretch ! ” exclaimed Aramis , raising his pistol as he passed by him ; but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off .

What was there in it ? ” “ A letter addressed to Monsieur de Tréville , captain of the Musketeers. ” “ Indeed ! ” “ Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency. ” The host , who was not endowed with great perspicacity , did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger .
One would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy ; for if Comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De Winter , he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was his eternal foe .
my dear Athos , you view things on the dark side , methinks. ” “ My dear fellow , I mistrust women .
“ My lord , ” said Athos , “ we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused , in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill , in so much pain. ” “ One must , ” replied Monsieur de Bouillon , “ sacrifice one ’ s comfort to the public good ; but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted .
He was masked likewise ; but I knew his step , I knew his voice , I knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity .

“ _Avanti ! _ ” said the same sharp and imperative voice .
“ How much in that little bag ? ” “ Seven thousand livres , in louis of twelve francs. ” “ Seven thousand livres ! ” cried Porthos .
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act .
The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars ; the other seats were filled by Debray , who was placed between the two Cavalcanti , and by Château-Renaud , seated between Madame de Villefort and Morrel .
“ God save the king ! ” was the cry in every direction ; the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window , looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed ; at which the cries of the multitude were renewed .
It could be seen that she had wished to speak , but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion ’ s words .
If it were nothing but a sword thrust , why then— ” “ I have counted upon you on this occasion , monsieur. ” “ Yes ? ” “ Seeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb appearance , and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de Tréville , and were consequently enemies of the cardinal , I thought that you and your friends , while rendering justice to your poor queen , would be pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn. ” “ Without doubt. ” “ And then I have thought that considering three months ’ lodging , about which I have said nothing— ” “ Yes , yes ; you have already given me that reason , and I find it excellent. ” “ Reckoning still further , that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house I shall never speak to you about rent— ” “ Very kind ! ” “ And adding to this , if there be need of it , meaning to offer you fifty pistoles , if , against all probability , you should be short at the present moment. ” “ Admirable !
“ You will be here at half-past nine. ” “ And I shall find your eminence ready ? ” “ Certainly , quite ready. ” “ Well , then , it is a settled thing ; and now , my lord , will you obtain for me an audience with the queen ? ” “ For what purpose ? ” “ I wish to receive her majesty ’ s commands from her own lips. ” “ She desired me to give them to you. ” “ She may have forgotten something. ” “ You really wish to see her ? ” “ It is indispensable , my lord. ” Mazarin hesitated for one instant , but D ’ Artagnan was firm .
why , my dear fellow , that on leaving us he lost his way , that ’ s all .
all England is with Cromwell ; and since you ask for my prisoners , I bend , sir , to your wishes .
must see him !
A short time since I passed through Marseilles , and went to see the old place , which revived so many painful recollections ; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure .
“ I am cold , sir , ” said Mousqueton .
Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard .
“ And here is Andrea Cavalcanti ’ s baptismal register , given by the curé of Saravezza. ” “ All quite correct. ” “ Take these documents , then ; they do not concern me .
“ Her Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor. ” “ And that in the presence of witnesses !
To the wall ; to the wall ! ” And the four friends , seconded by Grimaud , pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall , which bent as if pushed by the wind , and detaching itself from its base , fell with a horrible crash into the ditch .
And by whom were they recommended to you ? ” “ Oh , by the house of Fenzi , one of the best in Florence. ” “ I do not mean to say you will lose , but , nevertheless , mind you hold to the terms of the agreement. ” “ Would you not trust the Cavalcanti ? ” “ I ?
Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father ? ” “ I hope you do not doubt it. ” 30137m “ Go , then , into the drawing-room , my young friend , where you will find your father awaiting you. ” Andrea made a low bow to the count , and entered the adjoining room .
* We are well aware that this term , milady , is only properly used when followed by a family name .
_You_ , M. de Villefort , send for the priest ; _I_ will be the avenger. ” “ What do you mean , sir ? ” asked Villefort , trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Morrel .
Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida , and the Chinese eat swallows ’ nests ?
But never mind ; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous , and will have no bad effects. ” And Lord de Winter retired swearing , which at that period was a very knightly habit .
If you will only agree to my request , I promise you never to mention another word about escaping. ” The abbé smiled .
The host was in a lower and back room , to which Athos was requested to go .
The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal entirely .
At seven o ’ clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet , who at the second summons opened the door , his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night .
Now I remember quite well , that on the table round which they were sitting were pens , ink , and paper .
0295m It seemed , however , to Edmond , who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground , that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased ; nor did they terminate at any grotto .
“ Ah ! ” cried Blaisois , “ he is lost ! ” “ Grimaud ’ s a cunning fellow , ” murmured Mousqueton .
“ I have just had the pleasure , ” replied the count ; “ but I have not seen your father. ” “ See , he is down there , talking politics with that little group of great geniuses. ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent .
That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated .
“ Well , now that everything is decided , ” cried Porthos , rubbing his hands , “ suppose we think of dinner !
The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France , and also to escape the Frondeurs , who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville , in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes .
This is quite another man , and does not resemble him at all .
“ _Pardieu ! _ ” said he , “ here is a strange thing !
Nevertheless , knowing the weakness of her husband , and more particularly his cupidity , she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose .
It was seven o ’ clock in the morning , and daylight began to appear .
Zounds !
Ho , there , boy !
Here was another frondeuse to persuade , and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival .
“ Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity. ” “ But if he had escaped ? ” “ Impossible ; my precautions were taken. ” “ And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him ? ” “ The four Frenchmen , of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to me. ” “ And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done ? ” “ It is possible .
D ’ Artagnan , Going to a Distance to discover Aramis .
He might fail , but something must be left to chance .
He turned towards the sailor , who , during this dialogue , had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office , and asked him how these men had landed , as no vessel of any kind was visible .
He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape .
You are a man of taste .
No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it .
These two instantly mounted , the coachman of the latter replacing D ’ Artagnan on the coach-box of the royal coach .
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground , bathed in a pool of blood .
When he came here , Monsieur D ’ Artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers , in order , I suppose , to have his sword back .
He took a seat , and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary .
In fact , it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far .
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other .
The two friends made an appointment for ten o ’ clock on the following day ; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel , Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone .
If they catch thee , thou wilt be hung. ” “ True , ” replied Grimaud .
But I must not forget one grand point. ” “ Which ? ” “ That I have been singularly assisted. ” “ Nonsense. ” “ I have , indeed. ” “ By circumstances ? ” “ No ; by you. ” “ By me ?
Albert returned safely—then the count was revenged .
You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself ? ” “ No ; I do not wish to come between a father and son .
“ Yet , I am sure , she is not happy , ” said Caderousse .
She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room , with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion , and seemed to have made for herself , as it were , a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her .
“ In that case , ” commanded Comminges , “ silence that old woman. ” “ Ah !
The commissary then , instead of continuing to interrogate him , made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters .
not at all ! ” said D ’ Artagnan .
Aramis was astonished .
All I can say is , if ever I should get such a chance , the living should be my theme. ” 20143m “ And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen. ” “ But , ” said Albert , breaking in upon his discourse , “ never mind the past ; let us only remember the present .
Without your aid , ” continued he , repeating the count ’ s words “ I should have been a dead man—thrice dead. ” “ My antagonist took flight , ” replied De Guiche “ and left me at liberty to come to your assistance .
Chapter 116 .
Will your majesty deign to excuse me ? ” “ Speak , sir , speak boldly , ” replied Louis .
and shall we take no notice of this incident ? ’ M. de Morcerf turned pale , and clenched his hands on the papers he held .
If the four friends were assembled at one of these moments , a word , thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort , was the share Athos furnished to the conversation .
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised .
“ My father is proud , sir , and if he had not a meal left , I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone , except from Heaven. ” “ Well , then , after this first visit has been made we shall count on you. ” “ I must again excuse myself , M.

So that , thanks to her friend ’ s generosity , Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near Rome .
Thank God , I have never heard his name mentioned by any person , and I hope and believe he is dead. ” “ Do not think so , Bertuccio , ” replied the count ; “ for the wicked are not so easily disposed of , for God seems to have them under his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance. ” “ So be it , ” responded Bertuccio , “ all I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again .
All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten , returned ; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him , and discovered a new meaning in every word ; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words , until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven !
“ She belonged to one of the first families in Italy , I think , did she not ? ” “ She was of a noble family of Fiesole , count. ” “ And her name was—— ” “ Do you desire to know her name—— ? ” “ Oh , ” said Monte Cristo “ it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me , for I already know it. ” “ The count knows everything , ” said the Italian , bowing .
How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions ? ” asked the beadle .
You are not willing that I should kill my body , and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul. ” “ But I repeat it again to you , ” replied Felton , in great emotion , “ no danger threatens you ; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself. ” “ Dunce , ” cried Milady , “ dunce !
At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle .

Bravery is always respected , even in an enemy .

It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat ; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore .
From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow .
sir , thanks ! ” cried Madame de Chevreuse , seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips ; “ you have a noble heart. ” “ I bring him to you , madame , ” said Athos , withdrawing his hand , “ hoping that in your turn you will do something for him ; till now I have watched over his education and I have made him , I hope , an accomplished gentleman ; but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction .
“ Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me , partly to supply the wants of the poor widow , I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler , which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution .
There are moments—for if everything is not good , everything in this world is not bad—in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion , heart-arraigning sentiment : one of these momentary impulses actuated Anne .
“ If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey ? ” said Athos .
Now , if you marry M. Cavalcanti , and I get the three millions , or even if it is thought I am going to get them , my credit will be restored , and my fortune , which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality , will revive .
Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies , and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of M. de la Trémouille ’ s domestics in daring to make a _sortie_ upon the king ’ s Musketeers .
“ What , you do not know !
“ Now , monsieur , ” he said to Raoul , “ will you give me the letter you have brought ? ” Raoul handed the letter to the prince .

40086m “ Well , baron , ” said he , “ here I am at last ; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed , and they are not yet executed. ” Morcerf paused at these words , quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars , and which he attributed to his silence ; but , on the contrary , to his great surprise , it grew darker and darker .
“ Permit me to inform you , Count , ” said he , bowing , “ that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson & French , of Rome. ” “ I am glad to hear it , baron , —for I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants .
The procureur felt more at ease , although he had learned nothing really satisfactory , and , for the first time since the dinner-party at Auteuil , he slept soundly .
The Two Prisoners Chapter 15 .
The arrest produced no sensation , indeed was almost unknown , and scarcely interrupted the course of events .
He gave a ball every year , at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only , —that is to say , five-and-forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls .
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time , and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long .
War has broken out in Flanders .
I wish to see him at once. ” “ Ah , ” said the jailer , “ do not always brood over what is impossible , or you will be mad in a fortnight. ” “ You think so ? ” “ Yes ; we have an instance here ; it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad , who was in this chamber before you. ” 0119m “ How long has he left it ? ” “ Two years. ” “ Was he liberated , then ? ” “ No ; he was put in a dungeon. ” “ Listen ! ” said Dantès .
They hang , behead , and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner ; but some of these , like clever rogues , have contrived to escape human justice , and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems .
Has he built one here , then ? ” “ No , but he has a very comfortable one all the same , so they say. ” “ You know this chief , then ? ” “ I have heard talk of him. ” “ Favorably or otherwise ? ” “ Both. ” “ The deuce ! —and what is this condition ? ” “ That you are blindfolded , and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you. ” Franz looked at Gaetano , to see , if possible , what he thought of this proposal .
“ My Lord , ” continued Felton , becoming more excited as he spoke , “ my Lord , beware !
I have accustomed myself to regard you as my son : well , then , to save my son , I will sacrifice my life , nay , even my fortune. ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ I mean , that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune .
“ Today I am at your service , ” replied the count .
“ You have nothing more to ask of me , my lord ? ” said Rochefort .

He therefore told him all .
I will swear to you by my soul ’ s salvation , my faith as a Christian , I have told everything to you as it occurred , and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment ! ” “ ’ Tis well , ” said the abbé , convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth .
A carriage was in waiting .
If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur d ’ Herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder , I could have spoken out. ” “ What are you meddling with ? ” cried Aramis , pale with anger , suspecting that D ’ Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longueville .
Let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal , and how he likes ; but the queen is sacred , and if anyone speaks of her , let it be respectfully. ” “ Porthos , you are as vain as Narcissus ; I plainly tell you so , ” replied Aramis .
“ That ’ s lucky , ” said Athos , shrugging his shoulders .
“ You mean to say , then , my dear Monsieur la Ramee—— ” “ That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird , I will continue answerable for him. ” “ Take care !
With such a _vade mecum_ D ’ Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait .
Spaniards , Englishmen , and Italian malcontents , adventurers of all nations , and soldiers of fortune of every sect , flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants , and organized themselves like a vast association , whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe .
What with D ’ Artagnan , Grimaud and Mousqueton , we can manage to dispatch eight of them .
We shall serve in a campaign , seek out all sorts of adventures—return , in short , to our former life. ” These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt .
I have sent for three of my friends , but who knows whether they were at home ? ” “ Yes , yes !

I do not speak for him , but for myself. ” “ Well , sir ?
“ Why , your excellency , ” returned the landlord , chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency , “ I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel. ” “ I see that plainly enough , my most excellent host , and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I go .
“ You meddle with politics , do you—and still more , with cardinalist politics ?
Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet , and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock , silently opened the door , taking care that the light should shine directly on his face .
And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o ’ clock , an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests , consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _Pharaon_ , and other personal friends of the bridegroom , the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes , in order to do greater honor to the occasion .
“ Send the case before the judges ; it is their business to judge , and they shall judge. ” “ Only , ” replied Tréville , “ it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live , the purest life , the most incontestable virtue , can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution .
“ See what good fortune I brought you ! ” said Morrel , when he was alone with the count .
“ Morbleu ! ” cried the latter , “ I should say that I do pledge myself to it !

You do not know at all , and in this way they will chase him to Paris , without drawing a trigger. ” “ Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities , and will oppose to him an impassable barrier. ” “ Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm—all Lyons will hasten to welcome him .
Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic , tomatoes , and eschalots ; while , lone and solitary , like a forgotten sentinel , a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot , and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun .
“ Wait a moment , sir , ” said he ; “ I have an order for each of you also. ” He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up , and took out two ribbons of the Order of the Garter .
I know him for a Norman , and Normans are obstinate. ” In fact , tightly held as he was , Lubin endeavored still to cry out .
“ Well , well , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ this reconciliation is truly touching ; have you not tears in your eyes , Porthos ? ” “ Yes , ” said Porthos ; “ but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep ; I think it is the wind. ” “ Now climb up , Athos , quickly , ” said D ’ Artagnan .
Then came the question of gallantry and love affairs .
Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him , Caderousse began to go down .
“ By her step she must be young ; perhaps she is pretty .
It will be a work of time , but those who have begun by crying out : Down with Mazarin !

“ I do not say I regret ; no , I will never pronounce that sentence , which would not be orthodox. ” The Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven , and the curate did the same .
The damp had rendered it friable , and Dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels , it is true , but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful ; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years , supposing that the rock was not encountered , a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad , might be formed .
“ It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo ! ” exclaimed the procureur , with a haggard expression .
I come now to the last of the family , whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada .

“ Is my lord pleased with his escort ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan .
“ I know that it is terrible , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ but when I reflect that we have killed English , Rochellais , Spaniards , nay , even French , who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us , whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows—I can , on my honor , find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman. ” “ As for me , ” said Porthos , “ now that you have reminded me of it , Athos , I have the scene again before me , as if I now were there .
The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest .
He inquired how they were fed , and if they had any request to make .
The Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes , but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin , and their red caps , which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal ?
“ Return whence you came ; take back those horrible vegetables , and that poor kickshaw !
“ I thought , I must confess , that these tales , were inventions of the Middle Ages. ” “ Yes , no doubt , but improved upon by ours .

I draw upon him for 600,000 francs , my bills are returned unpaid , and , more than that , I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs , payable at his correspondent ’ s in Paris at the end of this month .
The youth brought a small loaf .
Such news was decisive ; it destroyed , in favor of the court , the struggle commenced with parliament .
The prisoners , therefore , had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors—which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts .
From time to time a dull sound was heard , like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea ; but nothing clear , nothing distinct , nothing intelligible ; it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake .
Is it not true ? ” The magistrate laid emphasis on these words , as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself , while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who , interceding for another , had himself need of indulgence .
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber , leaving the door open behind him , and making a sign to Milady to be silent ; his face was much agitated .
“ Well ! ” said Andrea , — “ my servant ’ s coat and my hat ? ” “ Ah , ” said Caderousse , “ you would not like me to risk taking cold ? ” “ But what am I to do ? ” “ You ?
THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES It was evident that without suspecting it , and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character , our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection .
No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her , while on his side the count thought she was about to address him ; but both remained silent , and after a mere bow , Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert , who received him cordially .
“ Nothing .
It followed that his hat was forever in his hand , which procured him some severe reprimands from D ’ Artagnan , who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence .

I had determined to make believe sup , but to eat nothing .
Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois , the only serving-man whom he had left .
Aramis related what had been agreed upon .
Doctor , my house is accursed ! ” “ What ? ” said the latter with apparent coolness , but with deep emotion , “ have you another invalid ? ” “ Yes , doctor , ” cried Villefort , clutching his hair , “ yes ! ” D ’ Avrigny ’ s look implied , “ I told you it would be so. ” Then he slowly uttered these words , “ Who is now dying in your house ?
This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France , but misfortune upon you , my Lord , for which I should never console myself .
It was to this effect : “ Tears , entreaties , prayers , have availed me nothing .
Employ me in any other way ; employ me even actively , but let it be on the high roads. ” “ My dear Monsieur de Rochefort , ” Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery , “ you think yourself still a young man ; your spirit is that of the phoenix , but your strength fails you .
“ Well , have you tied the knot ? ” inquired the grave-digger , who was looking on .
The Chancellor Sequier , who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly , stood before her , relating how his carriage had been smashed , how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel d ’ O—— , that the hotel was immediately invaded , pillaged and devastated ; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry , in which he was secreted by an old woman , together with his brother , the Bishop of Meaux .
At the beginning of this work , his servant , notwithstanding orders to the contrary , came to his room .
