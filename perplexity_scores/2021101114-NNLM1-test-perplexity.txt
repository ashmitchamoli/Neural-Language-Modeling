As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy , if we may credit travellers , the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity , but congratulated Albert on his success . <EOS>	570.294189453125
“ I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal , ” continued he , “ and the most profound respect for his actions . <EOS>	47.7598876953125
“ Go away , ” he said . <EOS>	15.498106956481934

Besides , ” he said , “ a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about. ” “ On the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , Edmond ! ” replied the old man . <EOS>	48.272132873535156
“ Go , Valentine , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , “ and leave me with this gentleman. ” “ But , grandmamma—— ” “ Leave me—go ! ” The young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room . <EOS>	70.14698028564453
But neither of these two wounds was serious , and they only fought more earnestly . <EOS>	226.53485107421875

There were collected and piled up all Albert ’ s successive caprices , hunting-horns , bass-viols , flutes—a whole orchestra , for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing-gloves , broadswords , and single-sticks—for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , Albert de Morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy ’ s education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single-stick ; and it was here that he received Grisier , Cooks , and Charles Leboucher . <EOS>	1786.8536376953125
“ ‘ No , ’ said Caderousse , ‘ we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs. ’ “ ‘ As you please , my dear sir , ’ said the jeweller ; ‘ I had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin. ’ And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold , and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper , and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes . <EOS>	91.41551208496094

“ Sir , ” said Athos , turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt , “ here is my sword ; have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison . <EOS>	83.31661224365234
Upon gaining this advantage D ’ Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! <EOS>	126.81642150878906
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked , ‘ How do they execute at Rome ? ’ and you reply , ‘ I do not know ! ’ And , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son . <EOS>	177.61907958984375

In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock . <EOS>	282.1077575683594
In that case your mother would hold me in aversion , and I do not at all wish that ; on the contrary , I desire to stand high in her esteem. ” “ Indeed , count , ” said Morcerf , “ I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me , and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose . <EOS>	115.38130950927734
Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with fear . <EOS>	195.8426055908203
He approached the other door , and taking off his hat respectfully , said , “ Madame , will you permit me to offer you my services ? <EOS>	61.90271759033203
At this announcement , during which the door remained open , everyone became mute , and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber , and entered the apartment of the captain of the Musketeers , congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel . <EOS>	144.37657165527344

That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or Germans. ” “ Oh , may God keep me from it , and you , too ! ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	90.7293701171875
“ Why are not my Frenchmen here ? ” he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; “ they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead. ” “ Well , ” said the president , seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent , “ so be it . <EOS>	105.73191833496094
“ One plan occurred to me , ” continued Albert ; “ Franz likes all that is eccentric ; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most alluring style , he invariably answered : ‘ My eccentricity may be great , but it will not make me break my promise. ’ ” “ That is what I call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself. ” Albert smiled . <EOS>	164.04043579101562
“ You seem secretly elated. ” “ Yes , Giulio , ” she said , “ proud and happy ; for I have found the means of strangling this hydra. ” “ You are a great politician , my queen , ” said Mazarin ; “ let us hear the means. ” And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper . <EOS>	152.8460693359375

I am stricken by fate . <EOS>	132.2198028564453
He extended a hand to Raoul and said : “ My young friend , all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here ; for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions . <EOS>	140.6222686767578
Andrea was supported by two priests . <EOS>	153.54010009765625
The little troop , without looking behind them or exchanging a word , fled at a rapid gallop , fording a little stream , of which none of them knew the name , and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham . <EOS>	284.87811279296875
“ My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us . <EOS>	386.5057067871094

Franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively , until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified “ Yes. ” “ M , ” repeated Franz . <EOS>	94.36800384521484

All at once , in a narrow pass , they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone . <EOS>	194.78916931152344
Why , you must have lost your senses. ” “ Whether I am in my senses or not , ” answered Franz , “ that is the way I feel. ” “ Listen to me , Franz , ” said Albert ; “ I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you , for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count , while he , on the other hand , has always been courtesy itself to us . <EOS>	87.74846649169922

Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could ; now there were two to be supported , and nothing to live upon . <EOS>	166.23681640625
But if we do risk being killed , ” said Porthos , “ at least I should like to know what for. ” “ You would be all the wiser , ” said Athos . <EOS>	59.55459976196289
He passed through several apartments , of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea , and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness . <EOS>	157.4179229736328
what ’ s that ? ” “ The Lightning , ” answered the captain , “ our felucca. ” “ So far , so good , ” laughed Athos . <EOS>	67.44573211669922
“ Yes ; you said you had an idea , ” said Athos . <EOS>	27.814937591552734
Besides this , as every great action bears its recompense with it , the brave exploit of D ’ Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost . <EOS>	233.83853149414062

Immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the _Pharaon_ , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old Phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city . <EOS>	333.6119384765625

“ The thing is clear as day , ” said he ; “ and you must have had a very confiding nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair. ” “ Do you really think so ? <EOS>	63.26915740966797
In spite of his usual command over himself , Dantès could not restrain his impetuosity . <EOS>	176.93833923339844

Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward ’ s extraordinary repugnance for the count ’ s projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey . <EOS>	274.1178894042969
He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant , and as the protection of the general , who is in the highest favor , was accorded to him , he was a captain in 1823 , during the Spanish war—that is to say , at the time when Danglars made his early speculations . <EOS>	168.46710205078125

We have secured him. ” “ Yes , ” said Aramis , “ through an infamous act of treason. ” Porthos pressed his friend ’ s hand and said to him : “ Yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! ” At this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected Charles ’ s retreat , was advancing to meet the English regiments . <EOS>	108.6501693725586
Now , as D ’ Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights , it was upon him that all the felicitations fell , which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis abandoned to him , not only as good comrades , but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his . <EOS>	119.04656982421875
Let me fight like a woman , then ; my strength is in my weakness. ” Then , as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance , so mobile and so expressive , she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger , which convulsed her features , to that of the most sweet , most affectionate , and most seducing smile . <EOS>	303.38916015625

Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present . <EOS>	378.3367919921875

Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law , but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession , a steel probe to search hearts , a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy ? ” “ Sir , ” said Villefort , “ upon my word , you overcome me . <EOS>	421.6658935546875

When he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him ; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this : “ We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs , and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again. ” Unfortunately , whether through envy or stupidity , all Morrel ’ s correspondents did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision . <EOS>	334.4231262207031

What matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should languish in prison , the victim of an infamous denunciation , to die here cursing his executioners. ” “ You are very humble today , ” remarked the governor ; “ you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey. ” “ It is true , sir , and I beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but I was mad. ” “ And you are not so any longer ? ” “ No ; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long. ” “ So long ? —when were you arrested , then ? ” asked the inspector . <EOS>	111.92860412597656

She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the Prince de Marsillac , the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld , whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Condé , her brother-in-law , whom she now hated mortally . <EOS>	203.44862365722656

Dantès had tasted nothing , but he thought not of hunger at such a moment ; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum , and again entered the cavern . <EOS>	128.26449584960938

I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually , and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship , the _Pharaon_ , did not come into port on the 15th , he would be wholly unable to make this payment. ” “ But , ” said the Englishman , “ this looks very much like a suspension of payment. ” “ It looks more like bankruptcy ! ” exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly . <EOS>	149.40895080566406
“ But in either case , what is to be done ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	19.352964401245117

But I swear to you , before God who hears us , that if you betray me , and my enemies pardon me , I will kill myself , while accusing you of my death. ” “ And I—I swear to you before God , madame , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me , I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone. ” Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samaritaine . <EOS>	108.38688659667969

To this dumb language , which was so unintelligible to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration , united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses . <EOS>	430.4184265136719

Albert went to his room , and dressed with unusual care . <EOS>	70.27965545654297
“ His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had , ” he said , “ given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships ’ orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion. ” They resolved to profit by the count ’ s courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained . <EOS>	205.97032165527344
I was like you , and had a king in keeping. ” “ Aha ! ” said Groslow ; “ what king ? ” “ Our own , to be sure , the little one—Louis XIV. ” “ And how long had you to take care of him ? ” “ Three nights ; and , by my troth , I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure. ” “ How do you mean ? ” “ I mean that my friends , officers in the guards and mousquetaires , came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting , drinking , dicing. ” “ Ah true , ” said the Englishman , with a sigh ; “ you Frenchmen are born boon companions. ” “ And don ’ t you play , too , when you are on guard ? ” “ Never , ” said the Englishman . <EOS>	108.6226577758789

The usher returned and made a sign to D ’ Artagnan to follow him . <EOS>	35.13828659057617
“ What is that ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	5.400716781616211
Look at Monsieur Mouston , see the honorable wounds he has received , observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance. ” Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced D ’ Artagnan had he dared ; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself . <EOS>	301.1470642089844
Then I admit my patience failed me ; I drew my sword in my turn , and as he came back to the charge , I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me , he let it pass through his body . <EOS>	124.17678833007812

Furthermore , D ’ Artagnan went with them , leaving Porthos at play with Groslow . <EOS>	184.24232482910156
Unfortunately for D ’ Artagnan , among the spectators was one of his Eminence ’ s Guardsmen , who , still irritated by the defeat of his companions , which had happened only the day before , had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it . <EOS>	82.72351837158203
He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged , though in a handsome manner ; but he claimed two hours a day to himself , consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants . <EOS>	195.94143676757812

“ Bertuccio , ” said he , “ give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur. ” The steward left the room with a faltering step , and returned with a bundle of bank-notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there . <EOS>	119.68644714355469
After the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . <EOS>	244.99758911132812

“ But , my good gentleman , ” resumed the old man , upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done , “ do not take on so ; they did not kill her , and that ’ s a comfort. ” “ Can you guess , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ who was the man who headed this infernal expedition ? ” “ I don ’ t know him. ” “ But as you spoke to him you must have seen him. ” “ Oh , it ’ s a description you want ? ” “ Exactly so. ” “ A tall , dark man , with black mustaches , dark eyes , and the air of a gentleman. ” “ That ’ s the man ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ again he , forever he ! <EOS>	62.669063568115234

You will not oppose M.

“ Quite , quite alone , ” replied the man— “ or , at least , practically so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing ! ” “ You are married , then ? ” said the priest , with a show of interest , glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	114.1072998046875
“ See what an exordium ! ” cried the Jesuit . <EOS>	61.66826248168945

“ Already up , Raoul ? ” exclaimed the count . <EOS>	40.87334060668945
Morrel followed him , and looked also for his sister and brother in-law ; he soon discovered them in another box , and kissed his hand to them . <EOS>	207.65536499023438

You will hear again from me. ” “ Come , come , ” thought D ’ Artagnan , emerging from behind the curtain , “ decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool ; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school. ” The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another , without uttering a single word ; the queen standing near the door , D ’ Artagnan half out of his hiding place , the king raised on his elbow , ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude , but instead of approaching , the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away . <EOS>	154.34771728515625
“ Speak , doctor—I am listening , ” said Villefort ; “ strike—I am prepared for everything ! ” “ Madame de Saint-Méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health. ” Morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes . <EOS>	213.75733947753906
Every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers , lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest . <EOS>	231.34622192382812
“ Ah , is that you , D ’ Artagnan , and you , Athos ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	12.086556434631348
Numberless groups paraded the streets and , whatever D ’ Artagnan might think of it , it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance , in order to assume a warlike aspect . <EOS>	352.75714111328125
an affair for the police ! <EOS>	161.40907287597656
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge ; such learning is very rare among ladies. ” “ Oh , I am aware of that , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ but I have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are reducible to figures , like an algebraic equation ; but go on , I beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree. ” 30069m “ Well , ” replied Monte Cristo “ suppose , then , that this poison was brucine , and you were to take a milligramme the first day , two milligrammes the second day , and so on . <EOS>	177.3037872314453
“ What is the matter ? <EOS>	11.098146438598633
Now , Planchet has an excellent memory ; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance , he will allow himself to be beaten to death . <EOS>	131.31114196777344
On his left was Porthos , whilst D ’ Artagnan was on his right ; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side . <EOS>	123.5296401977539
A strange thing is the mind , and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign , a word , a hope . <EOS>	150.5777587890625
Why ? ” “ Just remember what they said . <EOS>	60.14984893798828
It was like the eve of a battle ; the heart beat , the eyes laughed , and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose , was , after all , a good thing . <EOS>	91.50177764892578
“ Yes . <EOS>	9.715452194213867
The last Count of Spada , moreover , made me his heir , bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary , he bequeathed to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point . <EOS>	344.14251708984375
That ’ s too many , gentlemen , too many ! <EOS>	85.42428588867188
“ Yes , no doubt . <EOS>	12.316349983215332
Well , do you understand , monsieur ? <EOS>	21.577363967895508
“ Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors. ” Milady held out her hand to him . <EOS>	120.65340423583984
She appeared to be in ecstasy , and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her . <EOS>	82.83040618896484
A lady , it was said , had just fainted ; they had supplied her with a smelling-bottle , and she had recovered . <EOS>	92.1717300415039
Stand here , don ’ t stir , turn your back to the road and wait for me. ” Having thus spoken , D ’ Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village . <EOS>	218.7422637939453
Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of Athos than I have ; but I like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves . <EOS>	1136.391357421875
At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time , and at nine o ’ clock galloped into the yard of Tréville ’ s hôtel . <EOS>	74.65341186523438
The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him . <EOS>	60.58210754394531
“ I can not have deceived myself , ” he said ; “ I must look upon the past in a false light . <EOS>	34.83074188232422
“ And what , ” he continued , “ has been done with the poor body ? ” “ By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it . <EOS>	74.12679290771484
“ Well , you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says , ” replied Athos , shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity . <EOS>	53.919044494628906
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here ; it was that he might form some resolution , adopt some plan . <EOS>	217.2457275390625
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act . <EOS>	188.33424377441406
“ Still , then , I am a prisoner , ” said Milady , looking around her , and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer ; “ but I feel assured it will not be for long , ” added she . <EOS>	42.20009994506836
Porthos had his fits . <EOS>	154.6924591064453
“ Yes ; a passage of St. Augustine , upon which we could not agree , ” said the Gascon . <EOS>	51.07270431518555
it would be but an unsafe retreat . <EOS>	161.5048370361328
“ Ay , ” said Porthos , “ if we can not leave the camp , our lackeys may. ” “ To be sure they may ; and this very day we will write the letters , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	51.309844970703125
Dantès , your health. ” Fernand rose impatiently . <EOS>	244.6566925048828
When I return , which will be in about an hour , you must offer him to me as a servant , and upon your recommendation , though he doesn ’ t speak a word of French , I take him into my service . <EOS>	73.71443176269531
Divers descended in machines , made expressly on the discovery , into the bay where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves . <EOS>	400.22381591796875
A sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès , who must believe him dead . <EOS>	130.90365600585938
His head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , Athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at Grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately . <EOS>	203.3524932861328
Take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains ; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever . <EOS>	237.45889282226562
“ The best swordsman in the kingdom , my lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	20.266910552978516
Constance ? ” replied the young man , “ where are you ? <EOS>	29.75537872314453
Their joy was great . <EOS>	258.62530517578125
They dined apart from one another , wherever they might happen to be , or rather where they could . <EOS>	273.5823669433594
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto , —Villefort having retired as well as Noirtier and d ’ Avrigny , —her thoughts wandered in a confused maze , alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard . <EOS>	438.8995056152344
It must , however , be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme . <EOS>	190.9336395263672
“ The idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes ! ” “ There is something in what you have just said , ” said Beauchamp , laughing . <EOS>	72.62123107910156
how does he come by his name—his fortune ? <EOS>	680.2451782226562
“ Give it to me , ” said D ’ Artagnan , who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket , reckoning upon returning by that gate . <EOS>	61.13807678222656
hey ! <EOS>	345.3099365234375
The weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself Jupiter . <EOS>	414.4195251464844
your honor , in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels. ” “ What then ? ” “ Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV. ” “ Well ? ” “ In these books , your honor , ’ tis told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with—— ” “ The fattest among them ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing . <EOS>	228.439208984375
“ What am I to do ? ” she said , bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant . <EOS>	62.10639953613281
Submit this honour to somebody else. ” And he sat down . <EOS>	1675.068359375
At the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard . <EOS>	178.4735870361328
For him those ten minutes were very long . <EOS>	147.5939483642578
“ How can you find out ? ” “ You shall see. ” Gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes ’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land . <EOS>	145.4024658203125

Once past the frontier , Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds ; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres , which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all . <EOS>	578.0245361328125
Stop , there are a fine body of citizens passing ; quite attractive , by Jupiter ! <EOS>	416.9900817871094

Do you know in what crime you are to-day engaged ? <EOS>	106.1205825805664
Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week ? ” asked the mercer , piqued to the quick . <EOS>	89.07035827636719
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness , when again I heard groans , mingled with half-stifled cries , as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle . <EOS>	459.2469787597656

“ He certainly bodes us no good , ” said Athos ; “ but let us embark ; once out at sea , let him come. ” And Athos sprang into the boat , which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers . <EOS>	278.5472412109375
The sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : “ Who are you , gentlemen ? ” “ Two gentlemen. ” “ And where do you come from ? ” “ From London. ” “ And what are you going to do in Paris ? ” “ We are going with a mission to Her Majesty , the Queen of England. ” “ Ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of England . <EOS>	58.766258239746094
“ My son , ” said Anne of Austria , pointing to the musketeer , calm , standing uncovered , “ here is Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women . <EOS>	65.55622100830078
But this is droll , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , consoled , and holding his sides with laughter . <EOS>	51.99160385131836
Both went into the bedroom , and as the door of communication remained open , D ’ Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid . <EOS>	166.52630615234375
Monte Cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped . <EOS>	71.93843841552734
She turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master . <EOS>	83.5788345336914
“ To wait , ” replied Athos . <EOS>	12.435063362121582
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself . <EOS>	171.9223175048828

A sob was the only sound he heard . <EOS>	153.36712646484375
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet-de-chambre , who opened the door of the vestibule , then another which seemed to be that of a waiting-room , and showing them two stools : “ Your orders are very simple , ” he said ; “ don ’ t allow anybody , except one person , to enter here . <EOS>	173.5331573486328

Albert saw all these preparations and understood them , and exclaiming , “ My mother ! ” he threw his arms around her neck . <EOS>	92.76517486572266
De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been ; he rose , dignified and calm , restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man . <EOS>	145.6858367919922
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments , I shall find one both palpable and visible , on whom I shall revenge myself , I assure you , for all I have suffered during the last month . <EOS>	282.9430236816406

The president looked at his auditors . <EOS>	37.36688995361328

“ He brings an irreproachable name , which Maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the Legion of Honor. ” The old man signified that he recollected him . <EOS>	188.87025451660156
The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès , probably never to behold her again . <EOS>	135.02099609375
Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men ; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d ’ Avrigny , for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , — “ He is mad ! ” But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight . <EOS>	185.89739990234375
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime. ” “ Remember , ” answered the abbé calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , “ it is your fault , not mine , that I do so . <EOS>	136.22930908203125
d ’ Épinay can not leave the drawing-room at present. ” “ It is at this moment , ” replied Barrois with the same firmness , “ that M.

There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower-beds ; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure . <EOS>	991.915283203125
It must have been for his hide , for , _certes_ , the carcass is not worth eighteen livres . <EOS>	282.8301086425781
“ Ah ! ” said he , raising himself on his elbow , “ is it you , Comte de la Fere ? ” “ Yes , sire , ” replied Athos . <EOS>	15.89560604095459
“ What ! ” demanded D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	6.94404411315918
“ If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin , we do not understand each other. ” “ I don ’ t say exactly , ” answered the Gascon , confused . <EOS>	47.59502029418945
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper , which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident , monotonous note . <EOS>	1701.6278076171875
There ! ” “ Let us dine , then , ” said Porthos ; “ it is getting cold. ” The friends , at ease with regard to the future , did honor to the repast , the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton , Bazin , Planchet , and Grimaud . <EOS>	71.843994140625
“ Art thou dumb ? ” cried the duke . <EOS>	53.75746536254883
Poor Danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him . <EOS>	441.1441345214844
The two friends turned down the first street they came to . <EOS>	86.08676147460938
I sank on my knees , my hands clasped round one of the bedposts ; then I felt that I was lost. ” Felton became frightfully pale , and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body . <EOS>	268.47344970703125
“ Who told you so ? <EOS>	42.6617317199707

“ Father , ” said Mercédès , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table , “ sit , I pray you , on my right hand ; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , ” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand ; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart . <EOS>	189.63270568847656
No ; how would you have me know ? ” Parry bent his head and whispered to the king : “ It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends. ” “ Raising my scaffold ! ” cried the king , astounded . <EOS>	72.74180603027344

One morning the gardener went to him and told him , as if to please him , that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use . <EOS>	109.98527526855469
It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every instant . <EOS>	127.25334930419922
There he saw the grand-marshal , who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris , whose name I could not extract from him ; but this mission was to prepare men ’ s minds for a return ( it is the man who says this , sire ) —a return which will soon occur. ” “ And where is this man ? ” “ In prison , sire. ” “ And the matter seems serious to you ? ” “ So serious , sire , that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival , on the very day of my betrothal , I left my bride and friends , postponing everything , that I might hasten to lay at your majesty ’ s feet the fears which impressed me , and the assurance of my devotion. ” “ True , ” said Louis XVIII. , “ was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Daughter of one of your majesty ’ s most faithful servants. ” “ Yes , yes ; but let us talk of this plot , M. de Villefort. ” “ Sire , I fear it is more than a plot ; I fear it is a conspiracy. ” “ A conspiracy in these times , ” said Louis XVIII. , smiling , “ is a thing very easy to meditate , but more difficult to conduct to an end , inasmuch as , re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future . <EOS>	123.32870483398438
This Noirtier was his father ! ” Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès , or hell opened its yawning gulf before him , he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words . <EOS>	195.4635467529297
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor . <EOS>	155.59194946289062
But what do I see in the water—something struggling ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” exclaimed Raoul , fixing his glance on one point in the stream , splendidly illumined by the setting sun , “ a horse , a rider ! ” “ They are sinking ! ” cried Olivain in his turn . <EOS>	90.62931823730469
He could already see the intendant ’ s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief . <EOS>	602.0052490234375
“ And Bazin ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	11.830265998840332
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows . <EOS>	549.343994140625

It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them ; I saw him strolling about here this morning . <EOS>	592.7056274414062
“ That will serve us for a relay , ” said Athos . <EOS>	28.533695220947266
D ’ Artagnan then thought of that cottage , silent and obscure , which had no doubt seen all , and could tell its tale . <EOS>	151.24295043945312
The sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and I am to speak. ” “ Go , then , and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence , ” replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling . <EOS>	72.37437438964844

He followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees . <EOS>	184.25787353515625
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow . <EOS>	149.6048583984375
D ’ Artagnan reassured her as well as he could , and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Milady . <EOS>	77.85557556152344
No , happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father ’ s actions . <EOS>	263.59033203125
“ This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself , ” said Milady , replacing the glass upon the table , with an infernal smile , “ but , my faith ! <EOS>	42.889793395996094
MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD On the day after these events had taken place , Athos not having reappeared , M. de Tréville was informed by D ’ Artagnan and Porthos of the circumstance . <EOS>	204.0321044921875
The woman screamed , and cried for help ; but her cries were soon stifled . <EOS>	179.21347045898438
Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me , and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require. ” This manner of acting roused much respect for D ’ Artagnan ’ s policy among the Musketeers . <EOS>	223.5902862548828
D ’ Artagnan was too grand to promise anything ; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name . <EOS>	121.49288940429688

We must confess these three strange names struck us ; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms , under which D ’ Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious , or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which , from caprice , discontent , or want of fortune , they had donned the simple Musketeer ’ s uniform . <EOS>	303.84521484375

Totally disregarding the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman , aided by a powerful opera-glass ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing , were all so much engrossed with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass . <EOS>	321.74700927734375

They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant Adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . <EOS>	931.890625

“ Now , then , to breakfast , ” said Beauchamp ; “ for , if I remember , you told me you only expected two persons , Albert. ” “ Morrel , ” muttered Albert— “ Morrel—who is he ? ” But before he had finished , M. de Château-Renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , —that is , with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemart , —took Albert ’ s hand . <EOS>	136.04495239257812

“ You will , I trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you , ” he said , “ but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people. ” “ So much so , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count. ” “ Upon my word , monsieur , ” said Danglars with affected carelessness , “ I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions ; but the fact is , I was made baron , and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor , in return for services rendered , but—— ” “ But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette ? <EOS>	165.0360565185547

And yet it is very hard , ” added she , “ that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend , treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies. ” “ That is because your fancies go too far , ” replied the triumphant Bonacieux , “ and I mistrust them. ” “ Well , I will give it up , then , ” said the young woman , sighing . <EOS>	117.15628051757812

But he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen ’ s carriage had left the court . <EOS>	104.74404907226562

“ Yes , yes , ” replied he , “ I perceive that plainly ; but do you really believe it is she ? ” “ I am sure of it. ” “ Nevertheless , I confess I still doubt. ” “ But the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder ? ” “ She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France , and has been branded in consequence. ” “ Athos , she is your wife , I tell you , ” repeated D ’ Artagnan ; “ only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other. ” “ Yes ; but I should think the other must be dead , I hanged her so effectually. ” It was D ’ Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn . <EOS>	59.27039337158203

Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity . <EOS>	355.718017578125
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth , who am neglected and forgotten by my father , harassed and persecuted by my stepmother , and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man , whose withered hand can no longer press mine , and who can speak to me with the eye alone , although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild . <EOS>	345.14532470703125

IN FRANCE The first fear of the King of England , Charles I. , on learning of the death of the duke , was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais ; he tried , says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_ , to conceal it from them as long as possible , closing all the ports of his kingdom , and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone , taking upon himself , in default of Buckingham , to superintend the departure . <EOS>	250.7510986328125

The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear , since the people had nothing more just then to ask for . <EOS>	132.55677795410156
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy , pale , and threatening countenance of Fernand , as it was defined in the shadow . <EOS>	104.50568389892578
At length , about the hour the governor had appointed , footsteps were heard on the stairs . <EOS>	91.00546264648438
He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field . <EOS>	144.27499389648438
“ Now I am alone , my dear Athos , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ open the door , I beg of you. ” “ Instantly , ” said Athos . <EOS>	17.504709243774414
“ There are several branches of the D ’ Artagnans at Tarbes and in its environs , ” said the cardinal ; “ to which do you belong ? ” “ I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry , the father of his gracious Majesty. ” “ That is well . <EOS>	170.9522247314453
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him , and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss . <EOS>	125.685791015625
He then went straight to the door and knocked , murmuring , “ I will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap , but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse ! ” The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and D ’ Artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux , the door of which , doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him . <EOS>	123.4399642944336
This was Julie , who had become , as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted , Madame Emmanuel Herbault . <EOS>	147.8090362548828
will you let me be killed ? <EOS>	68.449462890625
Now , as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time , each becoming , naturally , more firm in his own opinion , M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly . <EOS>	278.7110595703125
Please follow me , ” and he went on before , followed by Athos and Aramis . <EOS>	96.47822570800781
It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . <EOS>	76.29261016845703
On opening the door , Villefort found himself facing him , and the young magistrate ’ s first impulse was to pause . <EOS>	134.73890686035156
Then they were both silent . <EOS>	58.01036834716797
“ A thousand pardons , gentlemen ; but no doubt this man brings me the news I expected. ” And rising also , he went off at a quick pace . <EOS>	141.4346160888672
Ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my images , three francs each . <EOS>	188.92123413085938
She had profited by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for Paris , and had reclaimed it . <EOS>	140.2940216064453
Well , sir , you ought to know that we no longer have a police , since we are no longer at Paris. ” “ I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are , but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections. ” “ But , God forgive me ! ” cried Anne , with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her , “ I believe that you are yourself interrogating. ” “ Yes , madame , here I have a right to do so , for it concerns Monsieur d ’ Artagnan—-d ’ Artagnan , ” he repeated , in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman . <EOS>	117.22943115234375
The prince read as he hastened on . <EOS>	112.26609802246094
Ah , that would indeed be infamous. ” “ How did Danglars usually write ? ” “ In a handsome , running hand. ” “ And how was the anonymous letter written ? ” “ Backhanded. ” Again the abbé smiled . <EOS>	191.23568725585938
“ I then swore that this woman who had ruined him , who was more than his accomplice , since she had urged him to the crime , should at least share his punishment . <EOS>	105.2457046508789

“ Yes , ” said he . <EOS>	4.4861531257629395
“ My lord , you are right , and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last . <EOS>	27.299583435058594
“ Oh , those Villeforts are an accursed race ! ” “ Truly they are , ” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone . <EOS>	87.87932586669922
“ But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , his eyes aflame , “ battle ! <EOS>	50.57154083251953
“ I entreat you—— ” continued Villefort . <EOS>	55.41734313964844
One thing , however , reassured him ; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off , and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders . <EOS>	97.0337142944336
“ Friend , ” said he , “ for Athos this is too much ; for the Comte de la Fère it is too little . <EOS>	41.421661376953125
That he has given the diamond to us only ? ” inquired Caderousse , half bewildered with joy ; “ yes , nothing more true ! <EOS>	105.00990295410156
“ Oh , madame , I do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times I am your most respectful servant. ” The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes . <EOS>	102.46017456054688
“ Decidedly , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , you are the man I have been seeking . <EOS>	26.134563446044922
They advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again . <EOS>	110.3305892944336
“ Yes , you were thinking of it , and with justice . <EOS>	32.15207290649414
“ Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ? ” “ Ah ! <EOS>	52.9609260559082

Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons ; Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands , Athos with his sword in his scabbard , his pistol in his saddle-bags ; calm and cool as if on the parade , except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes . <EOS>	222.81886291503906
Grimaud , meantime , undid the means of escape . <EOS>	117.12600708007812

At length Providence has done something for you ; he restores to you more than he takes away , and it was time I should die. ” Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim , “ Oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! ” and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , “ Oh , I have saved you once , and I will save you a second time ! ” And raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor . <EOS>	90.32601928710938
All the same , I should like to do him that service—what do you say to it ? ” “ I will tell the coadjutor , ” said Bazin . <EOS>	44.0565299987793

D ’ Artagnan took leave of Milady , and left the saloon the happiest of men . <EOS>	71.7496109008789
“ Sir , ” interposed Blaisois , “ I warn you that I can only swim in rivers. ” “ And I not at all , ” said Mousqueton . <EOS>	36.75100326538086
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche . <EOS>	244.9286651611328
“ Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation. ” “ Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and I have noticed that—— ” “ What ? ” “ That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform. ” “ You have evidently seen and observed everything. ” “ Let us proceed. ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Now as regards the second question. ” “ I am listening. ” “ Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès ? ” “ Yes ; a young man who loved her. ” “ And his name was—— ” “ Fernand. ” “ That is a Spanish name , I think ? ” “ He was a Catalan. ” “ You imagine him capable of writing the letter ? ” “ Oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me. ” “ That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never. ” “ Besides , ” said Dantès , “ the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him. ” “ You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? ” “ To no one. ” “ Not even to your mistress ? ” “ No , not even to my betrothed. ” “ Then it is Danglars. ” “ I feel quite sure of it now. ” “ Wait a little . <EOS>	136.9062957763672
He now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , dishevelled hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes , —someone by whose side he might weep . <EOS>	218.1936798095703
Cloud sounded half past ten . <EOS>	1038.34716796875
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment ; then , as if appearing to have formed a resolution , she said , “ I have an enemy. ” “ You , madame ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , affecting surprise ; “ is that possible , my God ? —good and beautiful as you are ! ” “ A mortal enemy. ” “ Indeed ! ” “ An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death . <EOS>	87.02886962890625
But he had scarcely left before Danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24 exclaimed : “ Fool ! ” Then enclosing Monte Cristo ’ s receipt in a little pocket-book , he added : — “ Yes , come at twelve o ’ clock ; I shall then be far away. ” Then he double-locked his door , emptied all his drawers , collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes , burned several papers , left others exposed to view , and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed : “ To Madame la Baronne Danglars. ” “ I will place it on her table myself tonight , ” he murmured . <EOS>	359.960205078125
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress , and always thickly veiled ; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot . <EOS>	300.01116943359375

Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures , united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love , had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another , and economizing their stores , and Albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance : “ Mother , we have no more money. ” 50141m Mercédès had never known misery ; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those synonymous words , there is a wide difference . <EOS>	504.32257080078125
“ Certainly ; his panegyric has been uttered. ” They parted , laughing , she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest , he looking after her with eyes of love . <EOS>	311.7658386230469
This smile appeared to D ’ Artagnan to be of bad augury . <EOS>	82.63536834716797
“ Maximilian , Maximilian , ” he said , “ the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian. ” “ Oh , do not fear , my friend , ” said Morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count ; “ I shall no longer attempt my life. ” “ Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair ? ” “ No ; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife. ” “ Poor fellow , what is it ? ” “ My grief will kill me of itself. ” “ My friend , ” said Monte Cristo , with an expression of melancholy equal to his own , “ listen to me . <EOS>	53.5086784362793

“ No , ” replied Mousqueton , “ Parry kept it . <EOS>	24.658313751220703

“ But , ” cried Felton , “ that is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there. ” “ And therein consisted the infamy , ” replied Milady . <EOS>	50.5839958190918

Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger , the queen , when his death was announced to her , would not believe the fact , and even imprudently exclaimed , “ it is false ; he has just written to me ! ” But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence ; Laporte , detained in England , as everyone else had been , by the orders of Charles I. , arrived , and was the bearer of the duke ’ s dying gift to the queen . <EOS>	98.7915267944336

One day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of firearms , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks , and hurried towards them . <EOS>	164.7535400390625

“ Was not your father a Bonapartist ? ” asked Monte Cristo ; “ I think I remember that you told me something of that kind. ” “ My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else , ” said Villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; “ and the senator ’ s robe , which Napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him . <EOS>	93.61180114746094

“ Athos , my friend ! ” And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other ’ s arms ; then Athos , looking into his friend ’ s face and taking him by both hands , said : “ What ails you , my lord ? <EOS>	64.76876831054688

He felt a slight disappointment , however , when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton , and when Porthos signified to him that the state of his household , though great , would not support two servants , and that he must enter into the service of D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	87.68125915527344
But this time , instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse , and advanced to meet D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	56.068607330322266

Besides—do you see that door , Athos ? ” “ Yes ; what then ? ” “ Well , you can go out by that door whenever you please ; for from this moment you are free as the air. ” “ I recognize you there , my brave D ’ Artagnan , ” replied Athos ; “ but you are no longer our masters . <EOS>	64.06210327148438
“ It is very hot , ” said Athos , drawing his sword in its turn , “ and yet I can not take off my doublet ; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed again , and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself. ” “ That is true , Monsieur , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ and whether drawn by myself or another , I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman . <EOS>	85.76435089111328

“ Well , ” cried his auditors ; “ at the moment you left his house ? ” Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat . <EOS>	102.19127655029297

The commissary then , instead of continuing to interrogate him , made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters . <EOS>	230.76097106933594

“ Count , ” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance , “ there is a beautiful Arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof. ” “ I know it , madame , ” replied the count ; “ but we are in France , and not in Arabia , and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another. ” “ But , ” said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , “ we are friends , are we not ? ” The count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson ; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled . <EOS>	158.13111877441406
Franz was too far off to hear what they said ; but , without doubt , nothing hostile passed , for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the peasant girl . <EOS>	270.6938171386719

Fortunately , the reader may remember , or may not remember—fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him . <EOS>	230.85572814941406

Bonacieux ; “ therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others—that is quite another thing. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine. ” “ Beware of what you do ! ” cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make D ’ Artagnan start in spite of himself . <EOS>	68.82919311523438
Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased . <EOS>	291.793212890625

“ But if it is a woman who writes , ” said Aramis , “ and that woman desires not to be seen , remember , you compromise her , D ’ Artagnan ; which is not the part of a gentleman. ” “ We will remain in the background , ” said Porthos , “ and he will advance alone. ” “ Yes ; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop. ” “ Bah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ they will miss me ; if they fire we will ride after the carriage , and exterminate those who may be in it . <EOS>	69.78643035888672

For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife , with two servants , —a chambermaid named Trinette , and a hostler called Pecaud . <EOS>	488.16632080078125

He then arose . <EOS>	46.13718795776367
Do you think it is worth while ? ” said Villefort . <EOS>	34.887107849121094
That was a noble example to follow , monsieur. ” “ Why , ” replied Danglars , “ not entirely so ; with the servants , —you understand. ” “ I see ; to your domestics you are ‘ my lord , ’ the journalists style you ‘ monsieur , ’ while your constituents call you ‘ citizen. ’ These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government . <EOS>	281.4402770996094
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal ’ s death as a deliverance ; and I , even I , opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand . <EOS>	167.17767333984375
“ Ah , Danglars ! ” whispered Caderousse , “ you have deceived me—the trick you spoke of last night has been played ; but I can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault . <EOS>	126.34550476074219
’ Twas too brief an enjoyment , and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health ( of which it was perhaps rather the result ) would not long survive such a mode of life . <EOS>	277.0704650878906
“ Not a step forward , or you ’ re dead men. ” “ Stuff ! ” cried Porthos , almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit . <EOS>	317.50701904296875
And you really mean to say ; monsieur , that my dear father is here ? ” “ Yes , sir ; and I can even add that I have only just left his company . <EOS>	39.61886215209961

The captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel ; so I took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then I jumped after him . <EOS>	76.7210464477539
He took his army to the priest ’ s , where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months , and to the cornet ’ s , who performed wonders ; but as Planchet said , “ People do not eat at once for all time , even when they eat a good deal. ” D ’ Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest ’ s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis had procured him . <EOS>	244.98439025878906
In this garden Mercédès had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously . <EOS>	187.2147674560547

They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole day . <EOS>	166.28286743164062
Come , I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold. ” Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around ; indeed , Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid , or uttering a word . <EOS>	109.81731414794922
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation . <EOS>	108.462158203125
I only ask you a simple question ; answer it ; —that is all I require. ” “ I love a young girl , count. ” “ Do you love her much ? ” “ More than my life. ” “ Another hope defeated ! ” said the count . <EOS>	83.53971099853516
“ Have you not let it go out of your hands ? ” “ No. ” D ’ Avrigny took the bottle , poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand , and swallowed them . <EOS>	66.30300903320312
Where are your passports ? ” “ We have none ; we left England , ignorant of the state of politics here , having left Paris before the departure of the king. ” “ Ah ! ” said the sergeant , with a cunning smile , “ you are Mazarinists , who are sent as spies. ” “ My dear friend , ” here Athos spoke , “ rest assured , if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport . <EOS>	102.65833282470703
“ Let us speak of my affairs , ” said Mazarin , “ since you will tell me naught of yours . <EOS>	36.458763122558594
In truth , in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers . <EOS>	200.5275115966797
The host insisted ; but the travelers were firm , and he was obliged to do as they wished . <EOS>	69.02912902832031
When he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , pried open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the phial contained , perhaps , twice as much more . <EOS>	221.3954620361328
Franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him ( Franz ) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so . <EOS>	246.4824676513672
Meantime , Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke . <EOS>	290.8495788574219
“ How long a start have they ? ” “ Two hours and a quarter , my officer. ” “ Two hours and a quarter—that is nothing ; we are well mounted , are we not , Porthos ? ” Porthos breathed a sigh ; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses . <EOS>	159.48280334472656
Well , I take you with me ; we conceal ourselves , and wait together. ” “ But I shall not be allowed to go ; I am almost a prisoner. ” “ As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal , no one will believe you anxious to follow me. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well ! <EOS>	50.42506408691406
The cardinal was , as we have said , in very low spirits ; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others . <EOS>	123.74051666259766
The count ’ s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man . <EOS>	124.48442077636719
( “ He were a dead man ” said the Gascon , “ if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment ; but for my part , before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once ; the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me. ” “ Hush ! ” said Porthos ; “ listen. ” ) “ Madame , ” cried the cardinal , seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back , “ Madame , what are you about ? ” Then he added in Spanish , “ Anne , are you mad ? <EOS>	113.45169067382812
“ No , thank you. ” “ Do you wish anything ? ” “ Leave me to pray. ” The count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel , who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees , and turned towards Paris , without once looking back . <EOS>	93.15422821044922
No , I feel that I have reached the goal , and I will go no farther . <EOS>	52.96625518798828
So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city , and in half an hour ’ s time he stopped before a little isolated house . <EOS>	119.67977142333984
“ We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand , —a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter. ” “ Oh , ” cried Julie , “ I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand , as I now kiss the purse which he has touched . <EOS>	183.13711547851562
I raised my head ; I was in utter darkness . <EOS>	88.47532653808594

“ I feared it , Maximilian , ” said she ; “ it is the counsel of a madman , and I should be more mad than you , did I not stop you at once with the word ‘ Impossible , Morrel , impossible ! ’ ” “ You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it ? ” said Morrel sorrowfully . <EOS>	91.59283447265625
But you remind me . <EOS>	44.6107063293457
The men I have put to flight will return reinforced ; if they find us here , we are lost . <EOS>	181.6168975830078
Well , my friend , nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow. ” “ Hush ! ” said Athos , putting a finger on his lips , with the sad smile peculiar to him ; “ let us talk no more of Mordaunt—it will bring bad luck. ” And Athos set forward toward Charenton , followed closely by Aramis . <EOS>	166.53297424316406
“ She is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress. ” Noirtier again closed his left eye . <EOS>	118.05280303955078
Shall I send the father to you ? ” “ Immediately. ” “ Very well. ” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars ’ contempt , Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker ’ s wife should exercise in providing for the future . <EOS>	146.65408325195312
D ’ Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it . <EOS>	41.38676834106445
he escapes us. ” “ So much the better , ” muttered Athos . <EOS>	64.84701538085938
Then there is his son , Andrea , a charming young man , about your own age , viscount , bearing the same title as yourself , and who is making his entry into the Parisian world , aided by his father ’ s millions . <EOS>	103.58483123779297
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin , who paid them numerous compliments , and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired , namely , D ’ Artagnan his captaincy , Porthos his barony . <EOS>	192.44189453125
Wasn ’ t I right to part with the horses ? ” Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt . <EOS>	297.6699523925781
He looked around him and saw Mme . <EOS>	45.731815338134766
The lady was surpassingly beautiful , while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her . <EOS>	310.1552429199219
“ Now we are alone , dear Aramis , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchet ’ s horse. ” “ I ’ faith ! ” answered Aramis , “ as you see , from Heaven. ” “ From Heaven , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , shaking his head ; “ you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there. ” “ My friend , ” said Aramis , with a look of imbecility on his face which D ’ Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers , “ if I did not come from Heaven , at least I was leaving Paradise , which is almost the same. ” “ Here , then , is a puzzle for the learned , ” observed D ’ Artagnan , “ until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise ; some place it on Mount Ararat , others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates ; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it , while it was actually very near . <EOS>	90.14926147460938

Four marble steps led down to the water ’ s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide . <EOS>	243.29579162597656
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists ; there were landscapes by Dupré , with their long reeds and tall trees , their lowing oxen and marvellous skies ; Delacroix ’ s Arabian cavaliers , with their long white burnouses , their shining belts , their damasked arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces ; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger , representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet ; there were paintings by Diaz , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his suns more brilliant than the sun ; designs by Decamp , as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa , but more poetic ; _pastels_ by Giraud and Müller , representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats ’ “ Travels in the East , ” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel , or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past . <EOS>	1237.779296875
Now , then , what had I better do ? ” “ Return instantly . <EOS>	69.30101776123047
Not at all , prince , ” said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title , “ what have I done for you ? <EOS>	105.31719207763672
“ Well , I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars. ” “ I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head. ” “ What fortune has she ? ” “ But I tell you—— ” “ A million ? ” Andrea shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	86.13993835449219
The guards asked permission of La Ramee , who gave it to them , but not till the evening , however ; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone . <EOS>	84.1116943359375
All fell to their knees . <EOS>	56.50221252441406
“ Do I look so ? ” asked the baron , rising and going a step backward . <EOS>	68.73509216308594
“ And no one thinks of us in this country , for each must think about his own affairs . <EOS>	93.2509765625

At the corner of the street they met the count ’ s steward , who was awaiting his master . <EOS>	35.74457931518555
And , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet , the count seemed to have the power of fascination . <EOS>	139.46701049804688

In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar , which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them . <EOS>	187.5748748779297
“ Oh , as for that , I ’ ll take you to a splendid place , ” said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse ’ s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him . <EOS>	98.65360260009766
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast ; then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain , and drank it . <EOS>	428.0574951171875
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : “ Go on , I know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , God and I will judge. ” “ Oh , father , ” continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , “ it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river , that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature—the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave—united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , ‘ Place for the justice of God ! ’ ” “ Delirium ! ” murmured the monk , shaking his head . <EOS>	158.2827606201172
Vampa took Cucumetto ’ s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto , while in her turn Teresa remained outside . <EOS>	180.53785705566406
But pardon me , are you free ? <EOS>	81.46299743652344
“ Now I think of it , you can do better , ” said Danglars . <EOS>	25.0949764251709
As he departed , Danglars approached , and said , — “ Well , it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo ? ” “ Yes , most satisfactory , my dear Danglars. ” “ Well , so much the better , ” said the supercargo ; “ for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty. ” “ Dantès has done his , ” replied the owner , “ and that is not saying much . <EOS>	71.69690704345703
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions . <EOS>	254.48484802246094
On rising , he went to his window , which opened on a terrace , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest . <EOS>	130.9314422607422
I can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars. ” 30107m “ Ah , ” said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , “ that may be easily explained ; the Comtesse de Morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough. ” “ I do not know if that is her reason , ” said Albert , “ but one thing I do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable . <EOS>	116.996337890625
Eh , gentlemen , let us reckon upon accidents ! <EOS>	183.79490661621094
With forty-five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years , and comfortably for four ; but before six months—you with your music , and I with my voice—we shall double our capital . <EOS>	685.6968383789062
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count ’ s pistol . <EOS>	230.5769500732422
So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone . <EOS>	64.54004669189453
M. de Tréville listened to the young man ’ s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair . <EOS>	102.56394958496094
She is young ; she is beautiful ; she possesses all earthly seductions . <EOS>	481.71832275390625
Come to us this evening and to-morrow we ’ ll return your visit. ” “ Capital ! <EOS>	169.11122131347656
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry . <EOS>	314.9951477050781
D ’ Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn , and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it . <EOS>	127.694580078125
He jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant ’ s arms , and joined them . <EOS>	53.5329475402832
“ Now , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I ’ ve one last favor to ask of you , Monsieur de Comminges. ” “ At your service , sir. ” “ You will see the count again ? ” “ To-morrow morning. ” “ Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained ? ” “ You want the cardinal to come here ? ” “ No ; I know my place and am not so presumptuous . <EOS>	44.49562454223633
“ Then the diamond is safe ? ” said he , timidly . <EOS>	37.39601516723633
Mercédès read with terror the following lines : “ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès , second in command on board the _Pharaon_ , this day arrived from Smyrna , after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo , is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper , and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris . <EOS>	181.51620483398438
Now this was a Sunday , and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him . <EOS>	99.69876861572266
“ Good-evening , comrade , ” said D ’ Artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner . <EOS>	79.78716278076172
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , — “ To the Island of Elba ! ” The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo . <EOS>	248.03628540039062
The mendicant hesitated at first , but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented , and walked on before Athos . <EOS>	96.06420135498047
He was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him ; this seemed a good augury . <EOS>	193.7787322998047
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man , wrapped in a large cloak . <EOS>	67.08476257324219
“ Yes—yes , ” said Caderousse ; “ but you were right to return as soon as possible , my boy. ” “ And why ? ” “ Because Mercédès is a very fine girl , and fine girls never lack followers ; she particularly has them by dozens. ” “ Really ? ” answered Edmond , with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness . <EOS>	118.11833953857422
‘ All hands to the pumps ! ’ I shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in . <EOS>	351.5821533203125
The two brigands looked at each other for a moment—the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow . <EOS>	141.1153106689453
‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo , who is now , I believe , in Paris ? ’ “ ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo , my foster-father , has been in Normandy the last three days. ’ “ ‘ Who , then , has counselled you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief . <EOS>	94.32864379882812
“ You smile. ” “ Yes. ” “ Why do you do so ? ” “ I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own . <EOS>	78.86054229736328
He found D ’ Artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante-room . <EOS>	66.92855072021484
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son . <EOS>	132.8218231201172
The house may be suspected ; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , for I can affirm , sire , if I can believe what he says , that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty , or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal. ” “ Was it not this D ’ Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day , in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Déchaussés ? ” asked the king , looking at the cardinal , who colored with vexation . <EOS>	116.96660614013672
She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English , who thereupon requested D ’ Artagnan ’ s permission to retire , excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away , and charging his sister to obtain his pardon . <EOS>	143.66148376464844
“ She is there , ” said he . <EOS>	8.692995071411133
“ One moment , yes , ” answered the queen . <EOS>	16.16260528564453
Nevertheless , knowing the weakness of her husband , and more particularly his cupidity , she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose . <EOS>	146.23245239257812
I have said what I have said. ” “ And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , in a low voice , “ I beg you to follow me. ” “ And when ? ” asked the Guardsman , with the same jeering air . <EOS>	41.99047088623047
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other . <EOS>	97.03741455078125
“ Why is that gendarme there ? ” asked Andrea of himself . <EOS>	55.43016052246094
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed . <EOS>	1027.6976318359375
my friend ! ” cried Athos , suddenly , “ where have you brought us ? <EOS>	40.41105270385742
You must have discovered a mine , or else become a stockbroker. ” “ So that , as you confess , you are jealous ? ” “ No , I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you ; but as I am not quite properly dressed , I chose my opportunity , that I might not compromise you. ” “ Yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! ” exclaimed Andrea ; “ you speak to me before my servant. ” “ How can I help that , my boy ? <EOS>	82.52908325195312
The assizes , also , were about to begin , and Villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse . <EOS>	142.1881866455078
A high wall , at the angle of which was the pavilion , ran along one side of this lane , and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers-by . <EOS>	169.05284118652344
D ’ Artagnan , who never turned his head , did not perceive it . <EOS>	24.113996505737305
“ Three , ” replied Aramis , smiling . <EOS>	12.960253715515137
to be sure , yes . <EOS>	45.50289535522461
M. Bonacieux was at his door . <EOS>	39.0921516418457
In an instant he was among the branches , and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion . <EOS>	124.17703247070312
What would the abbé please to have ? <EOS>	132.37051391601562
“ Ha , ha , ” said Château-Renaud , “ here come some friends of yours , viscount ! <EOS>	60.91572570800781
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	139.8916778564453
“ Oh ! <EOS>	7.909018039703369
“ Ah , my dear friend ! ” he cried , “ what bad stabling for my horses here. ” “ Indeed ! ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ I am most unhappy to hear it , on account of those fine animals. ” “ And I , also—I was also wretchedly off , ” he answered , moving backward and forward as he spoke ; “ and had it not been for the hostess , ” he added , with his air of vulgar self-complacency , “ who is very agreeable and understands a joke , I should have got a lodging elsewhere. ” The pretty Madeleine , who had approached during this colloquy , stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos ’ s words , for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated . <EOS>	146.26858520507812
His brain was on fire , and life and energy returned . <EOS>	194.0994415283203
“ What a devil of a face you have , Porthos ! <EOS>	79.4370346069336
After this second part of his discourse , fixing his hawk ’ s eye upon poor Bonacieux , he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation . <EOS>	190.48159790039062
The chocolate was inoffensive , for M. de Villefort felt no effects . <EOS>	122.89751434326172
How D ’ Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw . <EOS>	230.54209899902344
D ’ Artagnan preferred the second means , and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired . <EOS>	135.0265350341797
As for Villefort , instead of sending to Paris , he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès , in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely , —that is , a second restoration . <EOS>	262.0927429199219
“ About half-past six. ” “ We will be with you at that time , ” said the major . <EOS>	40.127079010009766
“ If we release the prisoner thus , we shall never know the truth. ” “ Athos may always be found , ” replied Tréville , “ ready to answer , when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him . <EOS>	97.1248550415039
We have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord . <EOS>	296.3199157714844
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered , Cromwell did not move . <EOS>	173.9959259033203
By degrees , the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them , and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel . <EOS>	191.21444702148438
“ As to Porthos , that is certainly droll ; but I am not the less a giddy fool . <EOS>	87.54410552978516
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment . <EOS>	674.3373413085938
“ Well , ” said Franz to him ; “ there is the beginning of an adventure. ” “ Laugh if you please—I really think so . <EOS>	81.47212219238281
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood. ” “ Did you see nothing there ? ” asked the count . <EOS>	52.510520935058594
A light yacht , chaste and elegant in its form , was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake , extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles , and from Tunis to Venice . <EOS>	634.909912109375
50211m “ Madame , ” said the count , “ it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness , but I offer you consolation ; will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend ? ” “ I am , indeed , most wretched , ” replied Mercédès . <EOS>	59.100215911865234
“ Run ! <EOS>	46.624088287353516
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground . <EOS>	476.6583557128906
Coquenard , they arose slowly from the table , folded their napkins more slowly still , bowed , and retired . <EOS>	261.6910095214844
Do you not remember him ? ” “ Yes ! ” said Dantès , and without relinquishing Mercédès ’ hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air . <EOS>	72.03654479980469
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair . <EOS>	70.76449584960938
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege , but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating , we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded , to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal . <EOS>	116.13902282714844
“ Certainly , ” continued Danglars , “ the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned . <EOS>	62.20402526855469
As to Athos , he remained unmoved . <EOS>	63.600162506103516
He had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School , and left it as sub-lieutenant of the 53rd of the line . <EOS>	566.9993896484375
All at once he raised his head ; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution ; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten , and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him , he shrilled it twice . <EOS>	188.33038330078125
“ You have deceived me ! ” said the cardinal , sternly . <EOS>	22.522151947021484
“ Will these be in your way ? ” he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; “ if so , they can be tied up. ” Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman . <EOS>	144.10592651367188
Death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow . <EOS>	213.13760375976562
“ A prisoner has escaped from the Château d ’ If , and they are firing the alarm gun , ” replied Dantès . <EOS>	80.76069641113281
“ Wait , ” said Athos . <EOS>	7.126838207244873
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds . <EOS>	157.4661102294922
He then repaired to D ’ Artagnan , who , thanks to his four trusses of straw , was in the act of making up and tasting , by anticipation , the luxury of a bed so soft , so well stuffed at the head , so well covered at the foot , that it would have excited the envy of the king himself , if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own . <EOS>	120.4757080078125
“ Ah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to understand . <EOS>	8.147723197937012
Let us load the guns. ” The four Musketeers went to work ; and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready . <EOS>	226.13778686523438
yes—I should expect so ; besides , if they forget , I shall take the liberty of reminding them. ” “ The queen ’ s voice ! <EOS>	126.33255004882812
I was only speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just now. ” “ And with all this , how unassuming he is ! <EOS>	405.5896911621094
“ How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning ? ” “ All owing to your influence , ” replied Monte Cristo , smiling . <EOS>	60.54191207885742
The prince , Monsieur de Retz , the Duc de Beaufort , the Duc de Bouillon , are talking over public affairs . <EOS>	57.51870346069336
On this conviction I allow her to speculate , she having her bank and her stockbroker ; she speculated and lost . <EOS>	471.3084716796875
“ Good morning , Benedetto , ” said Bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice . <EOS>	70.29943084716797
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman. ” “ A gentleman ! ” exclaimed Athos . <EOS>	31.32659149169922
Milady was only a queen while among queens . <EOS>	224.476318359375
“ Who are you , then ? ” cried all the witnesses of this scene . <EOS>	26.85302734375
He arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room , saw Haydée , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back . <EOS>	93.77017211914062
In a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed . <EOS>	412.30084228515625
“ Repeat it ! <EOS>	66.50880432128906
The Englishmen , convinced of these peaceful proceedings , sheathed their swords grumblingly . <EOS>	810.2249145507812
if this man should ever discover the names of the others , my master is lost. ” “ Haste ! <EOS>	91.16325378417969
“ You see , ” said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to Faria , “ that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you . <EOS>	107.19608306884766
“ I have brought her here , sir , and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte , who , till better advice comes , has bathed the foot in cold well-water. ” The guests now all took leave of Athos , excepting the old Duc de Barbe , who , as an old friend of the family of La Valliere , went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage . <EOS>	225.0280303955078
Save me ! —I will not harm you. ” “ Andrea , the murderer ! ” cried one of the ladies . <EOS>	98.29841613769531
“ You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux . <EOS>	122.12797546386719
The queen saving us , her friends ; nothing more moral . <EOS>	256.38787841796875
It appears the conquerors had something else to do. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , we shall find their muskets , their cartridges , and their flasks ; and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls , we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire. ” “ Oh , Athos ! ” said Aramis , “ truly you are a great man. ” Porthos nodded in sign of agreement . <EOS>	108.77250671386719
Athos and D ’ Artagnan said nothing , but their silence seemed to imply consent . <EOS>	98.88191986083984
The next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again . <EOS>	40.78354263305664
Now , as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance , as one calls his other hand to aid the first , I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there ; for I had seen you , Aramis , with the king , and you , count , I knew would be under the scaffold , and for that reason I forgive you , ” he added , offering Athos his hand , “ for you must have suffered much . <EOS>	108.32782745361328
To horse , my friends , to horse ! ” And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Béthune . <EOS>	130.79803466796875
Well ? ” “ Having , then , a keeper like La Ramee , I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me , who would assist me in my flight. ” “ Come , come , ” said La Ramee , “ that ’ s not a bad idea. ” “ Capital , isn ’ t it ? <EOS>	66.00494384765625
“ Ah ! <EOS>	7.6755828857421875
I know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune . <EOS>	50.43919372558594
Toxicology It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort ’ s for the purpose of returning the procureur ’ s visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion . <EOS>	60.52401351928711
You will take a biscuit with it , will you not ? ” “ Yes , I will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging. ” Monte Cristo rang ; Baptistin appeared . <EOS>	70.82891082763672
Laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep . <EOS>	68.1520767211914
Porthos came up behind , and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room . <EOS>	446.8484802246094
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . <EOS>	206.2793426513672
“ Scratches himself ? ” inquired the duke , “ what does your majesty mean ? ” “ Yes , indeed , my dear duke . <EOS>	37.622467041015625
Her face , as she looked at Athos , had taken on an expression that can not be described . <EOS>	64.7492904663086
He was discovered ; all hope of flight was gone . <EOS>	110.16514587402344
Do you not see how she suffers ? ” Haydée answered with a heartrending expression , “ Why should he understand this , my sister ? <EOS>	150.63937377929688
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , “ I thought so ! ” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground . <EOS>	169.11935424804688
“ Come in , my lord , ” said Philip in a low tone , “ and I will show you something droll. ” Morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall . <EOS>	134.96365356445312
“ I shall want you this evening , ” he said “ Return in two hours. ” “ My lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I have an appointment in two hours which I can not miss. ” “ Do not be uneasy , ” said Mazarin ; “ it is the same. ” “ Good ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan ; “ I fancied it was so. ” “ Return , then , at five o ’ clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you . <EOS>	34.100006103515625

Go to the parliament , for it was from this parliament , the enemy of monarchs , that the daughter of the great , the sublime Henry IV. , whom you so much admire , received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold ! ” And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation , whilst the cardinal , raising his hands clasped toward her , exclaimed , “ Ah , madame , madame , how little you know me , mon Dieu ! ” But Queen Henrietta , without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions , crossed the cabinet , opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal ’ s numerous guards , courtiers eager to pay homage , the luxurious show of a competing royalty , she went and took the hand of De Winter , who stood apart in isolation . <EOS>	233.4430389404297

He pushed the door open and entered . <EOS>	71.68049621582031
“ Oh , ” said Aramis , “ I always try to be prepared ; and then I knew you were seeking me. ” “ From whom ? ” “ From Master Bazin , to be sure ; he took you for the devil , my dear fellow , and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers. ” “ Oh , monsieur ! ” said Bazin , clasping his hands supplicatingly . <EOS>	74.47410583496094
Without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay . <EOS>	148.37692260742188
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre , he turned to the left , galloped across the Carrousel , passed through the Rue Saint-Roch , and , issuing from the Rue de la Michodière , he arrived at M. Danglars ’ door just at the same time that Villefort ’ s landau , after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house . <EOS>	133.69789123535156
“ Question , then , my lord. ” “ Where did the army cross the Lys ? ” “ Between Saint-Venant and Aire. ” “ By whom is it commanded ? ” “ By Count de Fuonsaldagna , General Beck and the archduke. ” “ Of how many does it consist ? ” “ Eighteen thousand men and thirty-six cannon. ” “ And its aim is ? ” “ Lens. ” “ You see ; gentlemen ! ” said the prince , turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers . <EOS>	276.34014892578125
“ Your treasure ? ” stammered Dantès . <EOS>	31.49918556213379
More than that , we shall have a tempest , or I don ’ t know what ’ s what. ’ You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon ; luckily the captain understood his business . <EOS>	307.0384826660156
Breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone—she , a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared herself mentally to Judith , the terrible Jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke . <EOS>	599.5470581054688
Unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture . <EOS>	180.6537628173828
“ I shall be gone only a few moments. ” Villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace . <EOS>	203.62408447265625
After giving some directions to Ali , who stood in the lobby , the count took Albert ’ s arm . <EOS>	85.21049499511719
Madame de Villefort merely cried , “ Be still , Edward ! ” She then added , “ This young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty . <EOS>	178.0085906982422
Have you not heard that some one is coming here ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , that some one will open the doors. ” “ But , my dear fellow , if that some one recognizes us , if that some one cries out , we are lost ; for you don ’ t propose , I imagine , that I shall kill that man of the church . <EOS>	67.80142974853516
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves , whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles . <EOS>	1115.2381591796875
we have a precious fellow here ! ” “ Monsieur Grimaud ! ” said the duke , “ for your sake I beg of you , never come within the reach of my fist ! ” “ Hush ! <EOS>	58.415103912353516
You have two unruly prisoners there , sir. ” “ Unruly , ” Comminges smiled ; “ you wish to terrify me , I suppose . <EOS>	126.57694244384766

His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter . <EOS>	112.4141616821289
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets , stuffs of the Levant , and cashmeres . <EOS>	408.6417541503906
“ Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them. ” “ Well , when Dantès was arrested , Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad . <EOS>	148.6787109375
He wished to hasten their steps ; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own , and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend . <EOS>	67.7131576538086
_Ventre-saint-gris_ , Monsieur de Tréville , as the king my father would have said . <EOS>	106.4504165649414
The popular banker found that it answered better than count . <EOS>	330.4009094238281
The queen breathed more freely . <EOS>	132.65667724609375
In dying , I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron : ‘ _Eo rus_ , and all will be over. ’ But come , Franz , take courage , your wife is an heiress. ” “ Indeed , Beauchamp , you are unbearable . <EOS>	500.0751647949219
“ But , ” said Mazarin , “ you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen. ” “ The king and the queen are my king and queen , ” replied the musketeer , “ my life is theirs and I must give it for them . <EOS>	46.122406005859375
And all present , even including Cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man . <EOS>	156.49473571777344
Athos rose , and offering him his hand , “ Be welcome , my Lord , ” said he , “ you are one of us. ” “ I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth , ” said Lord de Winter . <EOS>	44.63223648071289
“ This communication , ” continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , “ will , we are sure , meet with your approbation. ” The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more . <EOS>	221.51605224609375
And you will tell him I will publish the report of Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru , upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade . <EOS>	180.26852416992188
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him . <EOS>	55.67715072631836
I beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish , too Italian , or too Arabian . <EOS>	164.35995483398438
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell , for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility . <EOS>	186.84278869628906
“ My friends , ” said Parry , mounting the scaffold and standing beside them , “ would you work a little more quietly ? <EOS>	126.19395446777344
She fainted . <EOS>	96.15347290039062

It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot. ” “ Wait , ” said Caderousse , “ we shall see. ” He then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off Cavalcanti ’ s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself . <EOS>	120.97301483154297
There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps , amusing themselves with the following exercise , while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport . <EOS>	194.85354614257812
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned . <EOS>	404.8085021972656
The cardinal envied that composure , which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger ; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself , that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage . <EOS>	347.4680480957031
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin , who was running breathlessly . <EOS>	127.03502655029297
Besides , D ’ Artagnan has not told us his idea yet. ” And the Musketeer , with his usual coolness , reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast . <EOS>	97.56382751464844
“ You will not sign that order , my Lord ! ” said Felton , making a step toward the duke . <EOS>	41.96173095703125
“ You have asked for me ? ” said the Musketeer . <EOS>	15.398653984069824
Neither had any . <EOS>	387.6178894042969
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips , but rage in her heart . <EOS>	205.62686157226562
With such a _vade mecum_ D ’ Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait . <EOS>	1350.4462890625
“ I did not expect to see you again , ” said he feebly , to Dantès . <EOS>	37.90890121459961
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny ; we ’ ll have a supper here under your direction. ” “ Hum ! ” said La Ramee . <EOS>	123.7316665649414
“ You may guess , finding the luck turned , that I again staked the diamond. ” “ The devil ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , becoming angry again . <EOS>	87.80359649658203
“ Yes , he is a terrible antagonist . <EOS>	31.942678451538086
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX There was in all this , as may have been observed , one personage concerned , of whom , notwithstanding his precarious position , we have appeared to take but very little notice . <EOS>	240.16921997070312
I did not observe it yesterday. ” “ It must be the fog rising from the river , ” said the king . <EOS>	54.35709762573242

Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond . <EOS>	190.88885498046875
“ Half a million , ” said he , “ magnificent ! ” “ Half a million , is it ? ” said the major . <EOS>	32.6965446472168
And I have the same sincerity to show you , if you wish , Monsieur d ’ Herblay ; I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me. ” “ Really , monsieur , you say strange things , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	54.3174934387207
During this time , in the kiosk at my father ’ s feet , were seated twenty Palikares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats . <EOS>	144.6471710205078
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person . <EOS>	186.80296325683594
Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d ’ Avrigny ’ s door . <EOS>	58.573699951171875
She wouldn ’ t believe me , saying that she knew Anne of Austria , who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb . <EOS>	175.82872009277344
Planchet , by way of dessert , would have liked to hear the conversation ; but the citizen declared to D ’ Artagnan that , what he had to say being important and confidential , he desired to be left alone with him . <EOS>	112.41705322265625
“ Just so. ” “ Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud ? ” The traveler made a sign of assent . <EOS>	57.931114196777344

Four men , disguised as workmen , were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich , where a vessel was waiting. ” “ And knowing all that , your honor remained here , far from the city , tranquil and inactive. ” “ Tranquil , yes , ” replied Cromwell . <EOS>	161.13638305664062

Valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every-day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body . <EOS>	295.968994140625

When my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the Bourbons ; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountain , —theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result. ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ it is just as I thought ; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d ’ Épinay into personal contact . <EOS>	290.3687438964844

Aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room . <EOS>	176.5041961669922

I swear by— ” “ Don ’ t waste time in swearing , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ let us gallop , if our horses will consent. ” And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses ’ flanks , who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies . <EOS>	450.2168273925781
Did you see the president at the minister ’ s last night ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What did he say ? ” “ Something which will surprise you. ” “ Oh , make haste and tell me , then ; it is a long time since that has happened. ” “ Well , he told me that Benedetto , who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning , is really but a very commonplace , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death. ” “ Bah , ” said Beauchamp , “ he played the prince very well. ” “ Yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , Beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them ; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry. ” “ Then you never believed in the principality ? ” “ Yes.—in the principality , but not in the prince. ” “ Not so bad , ” said Beauchamp ; “ still , I assure you , he passed very well with many people ; I saw him at the ministers ’ houses. ” “ Ah , yes , ” said Château-Renaud . <EOS>	111.8432388305664
It would be , no doubt , _parbleu_ , if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance , of the horrors of the cardinal— ” “ Speak lower ! ” said Athos . <EOS>	117.1972427368164
The count , dismissing his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind . <EOS>	145.42784118652344
A small door , close to the lodge of the _concierge_ , gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot . <EOS>	257.7316589355469
All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day ; Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends—poor atoms , lost in that raging whirlwind . <EOS>	460.3050231933594
The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness . <EOS>	213.1865997314453
if I may ask without indiscretion. ” “ Near here , ” replied De Comminges , smiling ; “ so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are. ” “ He is wandering about the environs of the castle , ” thought D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	100.50419616699219
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing . <EOS>	370.42742919921875
He went straight to the queen , and in an altered voice said , “ Why , madame , have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs , when you know it would give me so much gratification ? ” The queen cast a glance around her , and saw the cardinal behind , with a diabolical smile on his countenance . <EOS>	79.69084930419922
“ Bring hither that horse. ” Friquet heard perfectly , but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road . <EOS>	227.4617156982422
“ Madame , ” said Villefort , “ I ask where is M. d ’ Avrigny ? <EOS>	19.325990676879883
They passed the barrier without accident . <EOS>	113.07606506347656
Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room , as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings . <EOS>	141.40696716308594
“ Yes , ” replied the old man . <EOS>	5.259780406951904
But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business ; I intended this money for the charity fund , and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds . <EOS>	372.4573974609375
“ ‘ Thou hast done well ! ’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice ; ‘ embrace me , my son. ’ 20115m Carlini threw himself , sobbing like a child , into the arms of his mistress ’ s father . <EOS>	170.35324096679688
She was struck , no doubt , with a superstitious idea ; she conceived that heaven denied its aid , and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen , her head drooping and her hands clasped . <EOS>	170.2271270751953
D ’ Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils , and believed them to be buttoned ; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened , and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators , but even the actors themselves , laughed like so many madmen . <EOS>	294.0164489746094

There is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys , large enough to hold all the world. ” “ Your valise is then empty ? ” asked Porthos , with simplicity . <EOS>	128.61972045898438
Do you know about that institution ? ” “ I have heard of it. ” “ It is a magnificent charity. ” Having said this , the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies . <EOS>	112.75962829589844
At daybreak D ’ Artagnan entered the chamber , and demanded what was to be done . <EOS>	42.505279541015625
But we have not done with the thing yet. ” 0087m “ Do you , indeed , think so ? ” inquired the marquise . <EOS>	103.49862670898438
“ Look , ” said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , “ here is in this cup some syrup of violets , and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook . <EOS>	160.21194458007812
“ _Au revoir_ , then ; that is all I have to say today . <EOS>	78.71286010742188
He invited me to dine with him on Saturday , which was a very natural thing for him to do . <EOS>	95.81684112548828
He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Milady ’ s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . <EOS>	112.70452880859375
“ Well , be on our side now , ” resumed Aramis . <EOS>	42.40741729736328

At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal . <EOS>	85.36939239501953
“ Did the people shout at all ? ” Cromwell asked . <EOS>	106.1764144897461
By eight o ’ clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos . <EOS>	22.837182998657227
“ From that time he received all who came ; he had an excuse for not eating any more ; the doctor had put him on a diet. ” The abbé uttered a kind of groan . <EOS>	126.54290771484375
“ Take care , you are going to immure a traveller , Sinbad the Sailor , a man who comes to see Paris ; you are going to make a patriarch of him. ” 20255m “ Oh , no , ” said Morrel ; “ my sister is five-and-twenty , my brother-in-law is thirty , they are gay , young , and happy . <EOS>	105.81614685058594
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated Cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me. ” 0233m “ The physician may be mistaken ! ” exclaimed Dantès . <EOS>	327.5731201171875
Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history ; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner , and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep. ” Then , the count added aloud , “ Was his name ever known ? ” “ Oh , yes ; but only as No . <EOS>	227.8331756591797
He has taken part against his queen , or rather , against her minister . <EOS>	115.01081085205078
Give your orders , and we will execute them. ” “ Then open the door directly. ” Peppino obeyed . <EOS>	136.49583435058594
The third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life. ” “ No , no , ” cried Dantès ; “ you are mistaken—you will not die ! <EOS>	122.5027084350586
“ He gave no other name , ” answered Julie , looking earnestly at the count , “ than that at the end of his letter— ‘ Sinbad the Sailor. ’ ” “ Which is evidently not his real name , but a fictitious one. ” Then , noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice : “ Tell me , ” continued he , “ was he not about my height , perhaps a little taller , with his chin imprisoned , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely buttoned up , and constantly taking out his pencil ? ” “ Oh , do you then know him ? ” cried Julie , whose eyes sparkled with joy . <EOS>	117.19388580322266

He knew that it was barren and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to plunge into its waves again , and swim to Lemaire , equally arid , but larger , and consequently better adapted for concealment . <EOS>	517.5311279296875

Morrel reddened , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him . <EOS>	118.22270202636719
“ I believe so , ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	10.192643165588379
“ For two reasons. ” “ What ones ? ” “ The first is that my mistress will never love you. ” “ How do you know that ? ” “ You have cut her to the heart. ” “ I ? <EOS>	38.743263244628906
“ Ah , ah ! ” cried one of the Guards , “ will you persist in saying , most discreet Aramis , that you are not on good terms with Madame de Bois-Tracy , when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs ? ” Aramis darted at D ’ Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy . <EOS>	123.49118041992188
“ _Pardieu ! _ ” “ And what do they say of it in the world ? ” “ In which world ? <EOS>	38.855621337890625

“ Tell her grace , ” replied Athos , “ that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes. ” Then , with renewed instructions to Grimaud , Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment . <EOS>	129.2045440673828
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given , D ’ Artagnan put his horse into a gallop , and in a few strides overtook the carriage ; but the window was hermetically closed , the vision had disappeared . <EOS>	158.59243774414062
“ I should be delighted to do so , ” was the reply ; “ but if I am not mistaken , the words ‘ In haste , ’ are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought. ” “ You are right , ” said Du Tremblay . <EOS>	68.5151596069336
‘ Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees , ’ said I ; ‘ confess how you obtained this animal. ’ Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said , and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity . <EOS>	408.722412109375

Bonacieux had also reflected ; but , it must be admitted , upon something widely different from ambition . <EOS>	371.6682434082031
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars , who had advanced to meet him . <EOS>	96.0574722290039
“ No , my friend , ” replied Athos , in his gentle but decided voice , “ we came here to defend King Charles ; we have but ill defended him—it remains for us to save him ! ” “ To save the king ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos . <EOS>	66.1448974609375

As a result she raised her head , opened her eyes , and sighed deeply . <EOS>	84.05191040039062
D ’ Artagnan flew to his hole , laid himself down on the floor at full length , and listened . <EOS>	73.42557525634766
“ Olivain ! ” he exclaimed , “ what do I see below there ? ” A second scream , more piercing than the first , now sounded . <EOS>	85.03092956542969
Then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months . <EOS>	163.78890991210938
All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct. ’ “ ‘ Monsieur , ’ I replied , ‘ it is not for myself that I entreat your interference—I should grieve for him or avenge him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would perish from want , for my brother ’ s pay alone kept her . <EOS>	247.7925262451172

The general remark is , ‘ Oh , it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters . <EOS>	237.49818420410156
“ And now you are assembled , gentlemen , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ permit me to offer you my apologies. ” At this word _apologies_ , a cloud passed over the brow of Athos , a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos , and a negative sign was the reply of Aramis . <EOS>	115.73843383789062
Am I deceived ? <EOS>	233.6381378173828

And the Greek princess , —will she be here ? ” “ No , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count ’ s establishment is not sufficiently understood. ” “ Wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to Madame de Villefort , who is trying to attract your attention. ” Albert bowed to Madame Danglars , and advanced towards Madame de Villefort , whose lips opened as he approached . <EOS>	87.79077911376953

“ We are alone , sir , ” said Buckingham ; “ speak ! ” “ My Lord , ” said Felton , “ the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson. ” “ Yes , sir ; and I answered him , to bring or send me that order and I would sign it. ” “ Here it is , my Lord. ” “ Give it to me , ” said the duke . <EOS>	59.172996520996094

D ’ Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many ; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position , like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him . <EOS>	148.43162536621094

Thinking of all this , and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse , D ’ Artagnan completed his short journey , and arrived at St. Germain . <EOS>	138.063720703125

The friendship which united these four men , and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day , whether for dueling , business , or pleasure , caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows ; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another , from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice , or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg . <EOS>	257.2714538574219

An hour had passed since the sun had set , when Franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . <EOS>	203.7958221435547

The papers said something about it , did they not ? ” “ Then you believe the papers ? ” “ I ? —not the least in the world ; only I fancied that the honest _Messager_ was an exception to the rule , and that it only announced telegraphic despatches. ” “ Well , that ’ s what puzzles me , ” replied Danglars ; “ the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph. ” “ So that , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month. ” “ Not nearly , indeed ; that is exactly my loss. ” “ _Diable ! _ ” said Monte Cristo compassionately , “ it is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune. ” “ Third-rate , ” said Danglars , rather humble , “ what do you mean by that ? ” “ Certainly , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ I make three assortments in fortune—first-rate , second-rate , and third-rate fortunes . <EOS>	146.1862335205078

Being no disciple of Cagliostro , I was wholly unable to do this ; so , by way of getting out of the scrape , I said , ‘ Ask Morcerf ; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers ’ ends ; ’ whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you. ” “ Is it not almost incredible , ” said Madame Danglars , “ that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command , should possess so little information ? ” “ Let me assure you , madame , ” said Lucien , “ that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal , I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo , whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob . <EOS>	209.1441650390625

“ Stop , ” said he ; “ I will go with you. ” “ Excuse me , sir , ” said Franz , “ since M.

He was rather too pale , certainly ; but then , you know , paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding. ” Franz smiled ; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion . <EOS>	424.053466796875

During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state , Valentine ’ s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man ’ s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted . <EOS>	311.9012756347656

What is your name , in your turn , if you please ? ” “ D ’ Artagnan. ” “ To yours , monsieur. ” “ And above all others , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , as if carried away by his enthusiasm , “ to that of the king and the cardinal. ” The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of D ’ Artagnan if the wine had been bad ; but the wine was good , and he was convinced . <EOS>	52.47806930541992
He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard , and followed him , crying , “ Turn , turn , Master Joker , lest I strike you behind ! ” “ Strike me ! ” said the other , turning on his heels , and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt . <EOS>	155.62771606445312

“ Touch nothing , my little friend , ” cried the count eagerly ; “ some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste , but even to inhale. ” Madame de Villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son ’ s arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count . <EOS>	141.86744689941406

“ I am twenty-one years old , or rather I shall be in a few days , as I was born the night of the 27th of September , 1817. ” M. de Villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date . <EOS>	121.37841033935547

“ I understand the nature of your alarms , madame , ” said the count , carefully examining the child , “ but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least injury ; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass. ” “ Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears ? <EOS>	111.35106658935547

“ Who is this young person , M. de Morcerf ? ” inquired Eugénie ; “ does anybody know ? ” “ Mademoiselle , ” said Albert , replying to this direct appeal , “ I can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing—the young woman is a Greek. ” “ So I should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as well-informed as yourself. ” “ I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_ , ” replied Morcerf , “ but I am reluctantly obliged to confess , I have nothing further to communicate—yes , stay , I do know one thing more , namely , that she is a musician , for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count , I heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own. ” “ Then your count entertains visitors , does he ? ” asked Madame Danglars . <EOS>	139.21771240234375
I hope that you will sometimes , too , think of me , and if at certain hours you should miss me , if you should feel any slight regret at my absence , I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself , and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you. ” After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him , whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper , a mute and touching caress , which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter . <EOS>	177.19381713867188
During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army , and made a fortune ; then with that money he speculated in the funds , and trebled or quadrupled his capital ; and , having first married his banker ’ s daughter , who left him a widower , he has married a second time , a widow , a Madame de Nargonne , daughter of M. de Servieux , the king ’ s chamberlain , who is in high favor at court . <EOS>	206.8665008544922

Do you think he would recollect you ? ” “ My faith , monsieur , he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me. ” “ Well , go and talk with the boy , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead. ” Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin , who did not at all remember him , and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible ; while D ’ Artagnan turned the two horses into a lane , went round the house , and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts . <EOS>	96.98167419433594

The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest . <EOS>	86.96382904052734
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness , only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes , like the effects of a fever ; his brow was more pale than it generally was ; his teeth were clenched , and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him . <EOS>	265.821533203125
“ But , madame , ” replied the count , continuing the conversation , and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine , “ have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ? <EOS>	65.09771728515625
“ Swear , then , ” said Villefort , joining the hands of Morrel and d ’ Avrigny , “ swear that you will spare the honor of my house , and leave me to avenge my child. ” D ’ Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “ Yes , ” but Morrel , disengaging his hand , rushed to the bed , and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own , hurriedly left , uttering a long , deep groan of despair and anguish . <EOS>	100.0653076171875
What is become of them ? ” “ You are very generous , gentlemen of the Guards , ” said Athos , full of rancor , for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day . <EOS>	68.87387084960938
Then , turning to Ali , she directed him to bring coffee and pipes , and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her . <EOS>	141.15386962890625
“ Ah , indeed ? ” said Cavalcanti . <EOS>	12.739067077636719

But you know him , M. de Morcerf. ” “ Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio , who understands hiring windows so well ? ” “ Yes , you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you ; he has been a soldier , a smuggler—in fact , everything . <EOS>	125.24868774414062
I not only permit , I desire ; let them come in. ” The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince . <EOS>	147.2089080810547
“ Gentlemen , ” resumed Aramis , “ any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrested—for we have friends in Paris—but we are contented with another course . <EOS>	179.9002227783203
“ Don ’ t laugh , my friend ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ for heaven ’ s sake , don ’ t laugh , for upon my soul , it ’ s no laughing matter ! ” And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror , that Athos eagerly seized his hand , crying , “ Are you wounded , my friend ? <EOS>	63.83916091918945
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution . <EOS>	127.19723510742188
It was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking ; a death without agony , a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine ’ s name and pressing your hand. ” “ Yes , you have guessed rightly , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that is what I intended. ” “ Thanks ; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart. ” “ Do you then regret nothing ? ” “ No , ” replied Morrel . <EOS>	88.00923919677734
Instantly a mask , wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman , snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance . <EOS>	420.56549072265625
This time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted . <EOS>	63.35915756225586
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it ? ” “ It has been in the family a very long while , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital . <EOS>	140.2301483154297

“ Adieu , Raoul , ” said the count ; “ adieu , my dearest boy ! ” “ Adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector. ” Athos waved his hand—he dared not trust himself to speak : and Raoul went away , his head uncovered . <EOS>	114.59526062011719
“ Do you , perchance , think I set any great store by life ? ” “ There is something horribly mysterious under all this , Athos ; this woman is one of the cardinal ’ s spies , I am sure of that. ” “ In that case , take care ! <EOS>	94.89649963378906
“ It is not your fault , my good Ali , ” said the count in the Arabic language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face— “ it is not your fault . <EOS>	136.16578674316406
But I do not mean , my friend that we were right in what we did . <EOS>	42.68452453613281
Oh , my lord ! ” continued the queen , without restraining her tears , “ it is better to fight as the king has done , and to die , as perhaps he will , than live in beggary like me. ” “ Courage , madame ! <EOS>	79.56584930419922

“ Really , Porthos , you are a gifted individual ! ” “ I have heard speak , ” said Porthos , “ of a certain Milo of Crotona , who performed wonderful feats , such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it—of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders , et cetera . <EOS>	311.7372741699219
It could no longer be doubted ; the family name was fully given . <EOS>	193.21591186523438

The stranger , whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom . <EOS>	158.98728942871094
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte . <EOS>	246.43710327148438
“ Undoubtedly , ” said Villefort , moderating the tones of his voice , “ a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which I was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground . <EOS>	233.11622619628906

But you , madame , so beautiful in reality , you , so pure in appearance , must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you thus. ” “ They have eyes , ” repeated Milady , with an accent of indescribable grief , “ but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not. ” “ But , ” cried the young officer , “ speak , then , speak ! ” “ Confide my shame to you , ” cried Milady , with the blush of modesty upon her countenance , “ for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another—confide my shame to you , a man , and I a woman ? <EOS>	114.84607696533203
Our duty is fulfilled. ” “ Not yet. ” said Aramis ; “ we have still a word to say to these gentlemen. ” And turning to Chatillon : “ Sir , be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I can not say before the queen. ” Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out , stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor . <EOS>	116.96231842041016
