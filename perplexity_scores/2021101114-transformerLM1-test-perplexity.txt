“ Have you proof of this ? ” “ I had it. ” “ And you have lost it ; how stupid ! ” “ Yes ; but by careful search it might be recovered. ” “ Really , ” returned the count , “ relate it to me , for it begins to interest me. ” And the count , humming an air from _Lucia_ , went to sit down on a bench , while Bertuccio followed him , collecting his thoughts . <EOS>	61.567779541015625

As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy , if we may credit travellers , the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity , but congratulated Albert on his success . <EOS>	510.0343017578125
“ I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal , ” continued he , “ and the most profound respect for his actions . <EOS>	31.179250717163086
“ Go away , ” he said . <EOS>	8.906980514526367
That mood lasted some time ; but now he ’ s as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs , which make one die of laughing. ” “ And Du Vallon ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	303.7258605957031
In this kind of game , not to kill is to let one ’ s self be killed . <EOS>	90.15691375732422

Besides , ” he said , “ a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about. ” “ On the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , Edmond ! ” replied the old man . <EOS>	39.08623123168945
“ Go , Valentine , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , “ and leave me with this gentleman. ” “ But , grandmamma—— ” “ Leave me—go ! ” The young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room . <EOS>	43.843963623046875
But neither of these two wounds was serious , and they only fought more earnestly . <EOS>	208.28785705566406

There were collected and piled up all Albert ’ s successive caprices , hunting-horns , bass-viols , flutes—a whole orchestra , for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing-gloves , broadswords , and single-sticks—for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , Albert de Morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy ’ s education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single-stick ; and it was here that he received Grisier , Cooks , and Charles Leboucher . <EOS>	1074.5545654296875
“ ‘ No , ’ said Caderousse , ‘ we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs. ’ “ ‘ As you please , my dear sir , ’ said the jeweller ; ‘ I had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin. ’ And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold , and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper , and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes . <EOS>	38.9876708984375

“ Sir , ” said Athos , turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt , “ here is my sword ; have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison . <EOS>	38.966285705566406
Upon gaining this advantage D ’ Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! <EOS>	108.3564453125
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked , ‘ How do they execute at Rome ? ’ and you reply , ‘ I do not know ! ’ And , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son . <EOS>	117.32276916503906

In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock . <EOS>	84.92286682128906
In that case your mother would hold me in aversion , and I do not at all wish that ; on the contrary , I desire to stand high in her esteem. ” “ Indeed , count , ” said Morcerf , “ I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me , and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose . <EOS>	76.54324340820312
Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with fear . <EOS>	166.46644592285156
He approached the other door , and taking off his hat respectfully , said , “ Madame , will you permit me to offer you my services ? <EOS>	42.7593994140625
At this announcement , during which the door remained open , everyone became mute , and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber , and entered the apartment of the captain of the Musketeers , congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel . <EOS>	114.6346664428711
“ Ah , ah , ” murmured he , “ is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society , that his protector thus employs the collective form ? <EOS>	213.27230834960938
These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy. ” “ But at any rate , you know where he is , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ? ” asked Raoul , somewhat comforted . <EOS>	43.66608810424805
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery ? ” “ That ’ s the man , my dear fellow ; he was an annoyance to the cardinal . <EOS>	58.379878997802734
That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or Germans. ” “ Oh , may God keep me from it , and you , too ! ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	72.89242553710938
“ Why are not my Frenchmen here ? ” he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; “ they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead. ” “ Well , ” said the president , seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent , “ so be it . <EOS>	72.08822631835938
“ One plan occurred to me , ” continued Albert ; “ Franz likes all that is eccentric ; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most alluring style , he invariably answered : ‘ My eccentricity may be great , but it will not make me break my promise. ’ ” “ That is what I call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself. ” Albert smiled . <EOS>	129.36415100097656
“ You seem secretly elated. ” “ Yes , Giulio , ” she said , “ proud and happy ; for I have found the means of strangling this hydra. ” “ You are a great politician , my queen , ” said Mazarin ; “ let us hear the means. ” And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper . <EOS>	106.36405944824219

“ Ah , _pardieu ! _ Is that you ? ” said Porthos to D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	13.75172233581543
I am stricken by fate . <EOS>	168.02841186523438
He extended a hand to Raoul and said : “ My young friend , all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here ; for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions . <EOS>	100.53582763671875
Andrea was supported by two priests . <EOS>	77.32488250732422
The little troop , without looking behind them or exchanging a word , fled at a rapid gallop , fording a little stream , of which none of them knew the name , and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham . <EOS>	163.3381805419922
“ My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us . <EOS>	283.1924743652344

Franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively , until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified “ Yes. ” “ M , ” repeated Franz . <EOS>	95.79267883300781
She could scarcely believe in her happiness ; and D ’ Artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written . <EOS>	61.22080993652344

All at once , in a narrow pass , they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone . <EOS>	100.34037780761719
Why , you must have lost your senses. ” “ Whether I am in my senses or not , ” answered Franz , “ that is the way I feel. ” “ Listen to me , Franz , ” said Albert ; “ I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you , for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count , while he , on the other hand , has always been courtesy itself to us . <EOS>	65.8527603149414

Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could ; now there were two to be supported , and nothing to live upon . <EOS>	139.63941955566406
But if we do risk being killed , ” said Porthos , “ at least I should like to know what for. ” “ You would be all the wiser , ” said Athos . <EOS>	44.31273651123047
He passed through several apartments , of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea , and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness . <EOS>	124.04310607910156
what ’ s that ? ” “ The Lightning , ” answered the captain , “ our felucca. ” “ So far , so good , ” laughed Athos . <EOS>	44.263763427734375
“ Yes ; you said you had an idea , ” said Athos . <EOS>	19.74861717224121
Besides this , as every great action bears its recompense with it , the brave exploit of D ’ Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost . <EOS>	235.83094787597656
God will punish you hereafter , but I will punish you here ! ” “ Ah , this is too much ! ” cried Buckingham , making a step toward the door . <EOS>	26.83915138244629
The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head . <EOS>	77.85431671142578
Immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the _Pharaon_ , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old Phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city . <EOS>	219.7805633544922

Why , having recognized you , and I the only one to do so—why was I able to save my son alone ? <EOS>	270.6757507324219
“ The thing is clear as day , ” said he ; “ and you must have had a very confiding nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair. ” “ Do you really think so ? <EOS>	45.0479850769043
In spite of his usual command over himself , Dantès could not restrain his impetuosity . <EOS>	147.84547424316406
A second discharge followed the first , and three balls , by passing through it , made the napkin really a flag . <EOS>	133.6354217529297
I am on my own ground , and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall , and to look over when I please , without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character . <EOS>	94.50616455078125
The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire ; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters . <EOS>	49.79030227661133
Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward ’ s extraordinary repugnance for the count ’ s projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey . <EOS>	241.36550903320312
He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant , and as the protection of the general , who is in the highest favor , was accorded to him , he was a captain in 1823 , during the Spanish war—that is to say , at the time when Danglars made his early speculations . <EOS>	157.77366638183594

But Parry clasped his hands and implored him , and at last he agreed . <EOS>	177.62594604492188

We have secured him. ” “ Yes , ” said Aramis , “ through an infamous act of treason. ” Porthos pressed his friend ’ s hand and said to him : “ Yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! ” At this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected Charles ’ s retreat , was advancing to meet the English regiments . <EOS>	76.702392578125
Now , as D ’ Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights , it was upon him that all the felicitations fell , which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis abandoned to him , not only as good comrades , but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his . <EOS>	89.19722747802734
Let me fight like a woman , then ; my strength is in my weakness. ” Then , as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance , so mobile and so expressive , she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger , which convulsed her features , to that of the most sweet , most affectionate , and most seducing smile . <EOS>	176.1311492919922

Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present . <EOS>	153.41004943847656

Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law , but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession , a steel probe to search hearts , a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy ? ” “ Sir , ” said Villefort , “ upon my word , you overcome me . <EOS>	346.7672424316406

“ You have no money coming in on which you can rely ? ” “ None. ” “ You have exhausted every resource ? ” “ All. ” “ And in half an hour , ” said Maximilian in a gloomy voice , “ our name is dishonored ! ” “ Blood washes out dishonor , ” said Morrel . <EOS>	61.038570404052734

I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading ; and as to the other papers , they sent a man off with the pilot , to whom I gave them. ” “ Then you have nothing more to do here ? ” “ No—everything is all right now. ” “ Then you can come and dine with me ? ” “ I really must ask you to excuse me , M.

30083m The curtain rose , as usual , to an almost empty house , it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance , so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it , that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals , while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors , and the buzz of conversation . <EOS>	217.98081970214844

Meantime , Monsieur , who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d ’ Angoulême , by Bassompierre , or by Schomberg , who were all eager for his post , did but little , lost his days in wavering , and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Ré , where they still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée , as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle . <EOS>	115.63825225830078

The queen was still standing when he entered ; but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair , and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools , and with an air of supreme hauteur , said , “ What do you desire , monsieur , and with what object do you present yourself here ? ” “ To make , madame , in the name of the king , and without prejudice to the respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close examination into all your papers. ” “ How , monsieur , an investigation of my papers—mine ! <EOS>	69.8301010131836
And they went out together . <EOS>	55.21653366088867
“ Now , my excellent Signor Pastrini , ” said Franz , addressing his landlord , “ since we are both ready , do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ Most assuredly , ” replied he . <EOS>	28.770503997802734

This is not a Corsican _maquis_ but an English garden ; badly kept , I own , but still you must not calumniate it for that. ” “ Monsieur , I implore you do not stay there ! ” “ I think you are going mad , Bertuccio , ” said the count coldly . <EOS>	104.8282470703125
Ask Baron Franz d ’ Épinay ; I think he tasted them one day. ” “ Yes , ” replied Morcerf , “ he said something about it to me. ” “ But , ” said Beauchamp , who , as became a journalist , was very incredulous , “ you always carry this drug about you ? ” “ Always. ” “ Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills ? ” continued Beauchamp , hoping to take him at a disadvantage . <EOS>	79.1689682006836
“ It was not your opinion that I asked , ” said the queen , sharply , without even turning around . <EOS>	34.34199905395508

“ I am at quite a loss how to answer you , I admit , ” said Mme . <EOS>	45.02468490600586

The breakfast-hour arrived , but M. de Villefort was not at table . <EOS>	74.59846496582031

When he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him ; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this : “ We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs , and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again. ” Unfortunately , whether through envy or stupidity , all Morrel ’ s correspondents did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision . <EOS>	229.07284545898438
At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination , the cardinal was satisfied . <EOS>	64.34636688232422
I thought he was up to something. ” “ It ’ s a misfortune , to which his friend , the devil , treats us , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	41.822689056396484
“ If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness , you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from Pianosa , but only from the sea. ” “ You think , then , this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors ? ” “ That is what we must find out , ” returned Gaetano , fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star . <EOS>	66.7757339477539

“ Well , he did remain with them ; and your Majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry. ” “ He who wounded Jussac ! ” cried the king , “ he , a boy ! <EOS>	134.3108673095703
Château-Renaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder . <EOS>	319.7161865234375
The coadjutor bowed and left the palace , casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes . <EOS>	200.3402862548828
Besides , I shall only take the time to go and return. ” “ Yes , yes , I understand , ” said Danglars , and then in a low tone , he added , “ To Paris , no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him . <EOS>	33.20927810668945
“ Hold your tongue , hypocrite , ” said Andrea ; “ you love me ! ” “ Yes , I do , or may the devil take me . <EOS>	31.897884368896484

“ Yes , if it isn ’ t contrary to the rules. ” “ Oh , no , ” said the gardener ; “ not in the least , since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying. ” “ I have been told , ” said the count , “ that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat. ” “ That is true , sir , and that is what I like best , ” said the man , smiling . <EOS>	38.128238677978516

You see it is not my fault. ” And Maximilian was patient , and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls , —one fair , with soft languishing eyes , a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow ; the other a brunette , with a fierce and haughty expression , and as straight as a poplar . <EOS>	349.7720642089844
After this , satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at Meung , without remorse for the past , confident in the present , and full of hope for the future , he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave . <EOS>	105.20903015136719
At this Athos would smile , with his charming , melancholy smile , which so became his noble countenance , and Porthos would drink , swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_ . <EOS>	259.7518310546875
What matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should languish in prison , the victim of an infamous denunciation , to die here cursing his executioners. ” “ You are very humble today , ” remarked the governor ; “ you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey. ” “ It is true , sir , and I beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but I was mad. ” “ And you are not so any longer ? ” “ No ; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long. ” “ So long ? —when were you arrested , then ? ” asked the inspector . <EOS>	76.93312072753906
“ My daughter , ” continued the banker , “ you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you , who is determined she will not marry ; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me , who has decided that his daughter shall marry. ” Eugénie bowed , not as a submissive daughter , but as an adversary prepared for a discussion . <EOS>	87.90312957763672

The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed , and which indeed have survived them , of the procurators of the period—meanness , stinginess , fasts ; but as , after all , excepting some few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable , the procurator ’ s wife had been tolerably liberal—that is , be it understood , for a procurator ’ s wife—he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind . <EOS>	441.0200500488281

“ I wish , ” he said , with his cunning smile , “ to prevent them from being ungrateful to me. ” “ It is but Christian charity , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ not to lead one ’ s neighbors into temptation. ” “ It is exactly for that reason , ” said Mazarin , “ that I wish to start before them. ” D ’ Artagnan smiled—he was just the man to understand the astute Italian . <EOS>	56.40788650512695

“ Does anyone dare to slander me ? ” “ Monsieur , I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation. ” “ Then , sir , I am patiently to submit to your refusal ? ” “ Yes , sir , although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive , for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance , and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman. ” “ Enough , sir , ” said Morcerf , “ we will speak no more on the subject. ” And clutching his gloves in anger , he left the apartment . <EOS>	75.61884307861328

Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon , let me take the place of the dead ! ” Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision , and , indeed , that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution , he bent over the appalling shroud , opened it with the knife which Faria had made , drew the corpse from the sack , and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber , laid it on his couch , tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own , covered it with his counterpane , once again kissed the ice-cold brow , and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes , which glared horribly , turned the head towards the wall , so that the jailer might , when he brought the evening meal , believe that he was asleep , as was his frequent custom ; entered the tunnel again , drew the bed against the wall , returned to the other cell , took from the hiding-place the needle and thread , flung off his rags , that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas , and getting inside the sack , placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid , and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside . <EOS>	208.658447265625

“ His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had , ” he said , “ given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships ’ orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion. ” They resolved to profit by the count ’ s courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained . <EOS>	148.80006408691406

Unfortunately for D ’ Artagnan , among the spectators was one of his Eminence ’ s Guardsmen , who , still irritated by the defeat of his companions , which had happened only the day before , had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it . <EOS>	58.64289474487305

“ Bertuccio , ” said he , “ give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur. ” The steward left the room with a faltering step , and returned with a bundle of bank-notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there . <EOS>	74.99320983886719
After the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . <EOS>	170.39434814453125

“ Already up , Raoul ? ” exclaimed the count . <EOS>	57.915592193603516
Morrel followed him , and looked also for his sister and brother in-law ; he soon discovered them in another box , and kissed his hand to them . <EOS>	121.12510681152344

You will hear again from me. ” “ Come , come , ” thought D ’ Artagnan , emerging from behind the curtain , “ decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool ; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school. ” The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another , without uttering a single word ; the queen standing near the door , D ’ Artagnan half out of his hiding place , the king raised on his elbow , ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude , but instead of approaching , the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away . <EOS>	104.00447845458984
“ Speak , doctor—I am listening , ” said Villefort ; “ strike—I am prepared for everything ! ” “ Madame de Saint-Méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health. ” Morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes . <EOS>	150.90969848632812
Every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers , lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest . <EOS>	167.27232360839844
“ Ah , is that you , D ’ Artagnan , and you , Athos ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	10.74149227142334
Numberless groups paraded the streets and , whatever D ’ Artagnan might think of it , it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance , in order to assume a warlike aspect . <EOS>	221.18283081054688
an affair for the police ! <EOS>	83.04285430908203
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge ; such learning is very rare among ladies. ” “ Oh , I am aware of that , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ but I have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are reducible to figures , like an algebraic equation ; but go on , I beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree. ” 30069m “ Well , ” replied Monte Cristo “ suppose , then , that this poison was brucine , and you were to take a milligramme the first day , two milligrammes the second day , and so on . <EOS>	121.76361846923828
“ What is the matter ? <EOS>	8.925532341003418
Now , Planchet has an excellent memory ; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance , he will allow himself to be beaten to death . <EOS>	119.5844497680664
On his left was Porthos , whilst D ’ Artagnan was on his right ; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side . <EOS>	91.97245788574219
A strange thing is the mind , and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign , a word , a hope . <EOS>	129.7032470703125
Why ? ” “ Just remember what they said . <EOS>	53.27680587768555
It was like the eve of a battle ; the heart beat , the eyes laughed , and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose , was , after all , a good thing . <EOS>	93.70545196533203
“ Yes . <EOS>	14.232611656188965
The last Count of Spada , moreover , made me his heir , bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary , he bequeathed to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point . <EOS>	239.53948974609375
That ’ s too many , gentlemen , too many ! <EOS>	65.30132293701172

“ Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors. ” Milady held out her hand to him . <EOS>	87.31764221191406
She appeared to be in ecstasy , and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her . <EOS>	49.82942199707031
A lady , it was said , had just fainted ; they had supplied her with a smelling-bottle , and she had recovered . <EOS>	83.94781494140625
Stand here , don ’ t stir , turn your back to the road and wait for me. ” Having thus spoken , D ’ Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village . <EOS>	130.9697265625
Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of Athos than I have ; but I like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves . <EOS>	832.4970092773438
At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time , and at nine o ’ clock galloped into the yard of Tréville ’ s hôtel . <EOS>	47.151493072509766
The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him . <EOS>	42.799949645996094
“ I can not have deceived myself , ” he said ; “ I must look upon the past in a false light . <EOS>	26.56999969482422
“ And what , ” he continued , “ has been done with the poor body ? ” “ By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it . <EOS>	59.5718994140625
“ Well , you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says , ” replied Athos , shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity . <EOS>	27.858985900878906
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here ; it was that he might form some resolution , adopt some plan . <EOS>	198.64013671875
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act . <EOS>	122.84343719482422
“ Still , then , I am a prisoner , ” said Milady , looking around her , and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer ; “ but I feel assured it will not be for long , ” added she . <EOS>	30.931846618652344
Porthos had his fits . <EOS>	111.12446594238281
“ Yes ; a passage of St. Augustine , upon which we could not agree , ” said the Gascon . <EOS>	36.69911575317383
it would be but an unsafe retreat . <EOS>	182.994384765625
“ Ay , ” said Porthos , “ if we can not leave the camp , our lackeys may. ” “ To be sure they may ; and this very day we will write the letters , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	32.723201751708984
Dantès , your health. ” Fernand rose impatiently . <EOS>	94.19649505615234
When I return , which will be in about an hour , you must offer him to me as a servant , and upon your recommendation , though he doesn ’ t speak a word of French , I take him into my service . <EOS>	50.13716125488281
Divers descended in machines , made expressly on the discovery , into the bay where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves . <EOS>	307.30914306640625
A sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès , who must believe him dead . <EOS>	69.21162414550781
His head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , Athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at Grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately . <EOS>	170.1146697998047
Take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains ; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever . <EOS>	212.91586303710938

Their joy was great . <EOS>	306.6561584472656
They dined apart from one another , wherever they might happen to be , or rather where they could . <EOS>	159.25665283203125
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto , —Villefort having retired as well as Noirtier and d ’ Avrigny , —her thoughts wandered in a confused maze , alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard . <EOS>	278.5546875
It must , however , be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme . <EOS>	107.3452377319336
“ The idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes ! ” “ There is something in what you have just said , ” said Beauchamp , laughing . <EOS>	35.580291748046875
how does he come by his name—his fortune ? <EOS>	245.32818603515625
“ Give it to me , ” said D ’ Artagnan , who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket , reckoning upon returning by that gate . <EOS>	49.8563117980957
hey ! <EOS>	278.735107421875
The weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself Jupiter . <EOS>	483.36187744140625
your honor , in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels. ” “ What then ? ” “ Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV. ” “ Well ? ” “ In these books , your honor , ’ tis told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with—— ” “ The fattest among them ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing . <EOS>	185.92648315429688
“ What am I to do ? ” she said , bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant . <EOS>	30.93408203125
Submit this honour to somebody else. ” And he sat down . <EOS>	826.220947265625
At the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard . <EOS>	115.566650390625
For him those ten minutes were very long . <EOS>	242.65602111816406
“ How can you find out ? ” “ You shall see. ” Gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes ’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land . <EOS>	102.600341796875

Once past the frontier , Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds ; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres , which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all . <EOS>	506.2744445800781

“ He certainly bodes us no good , ” said Athos ; “ but let us embark ; once out at sea , let him come. ” And Athos sprang into the boat , which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers . <EOS>	192.683837890625
The sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : “ Who are you , gentlemen ? ” “ Two gentlemen. ” “ And where do you come from ? ” “ From London. ” “ And what are you going to do in Paris ? ” “ We are going with a mission to Her Majesty , the Queen of England. ” “ Ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of England . <EOS>	39.00627517700195

But this is droll , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , consoled , and holding his sides with laughter . <EOS>	55.226593017578125
Both went into the bedroom , and as the door of communication remained open , D ’ Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid . <EOS>	87.82164001464844
Monte Cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped . <EOS>	35.41927719116211
She turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master . <EOS>	83.13671875
“ To wait , ” replied Athos . <EOS>	12.329833030700684
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself . <EOS>	134.35467529296875

A sob was the only sound he heard . <EOS>	89.46643829345703
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet-de-chambre , who opened the door of the vestibule , then another which seemed to be that of a waiting-room , and showing them two stools : “ Your orders are very simple , ” he said ; “ don ’ t allow anybody , except one person , to enter here . <EOS>	138.53860473632812

De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been ; he rose , dignified and calm , restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man . <EOS>	96.69750213623047
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments , I shall find one both palpable and visible , on whom I shall revenge myself , I assure you , for all I have suffered during the last month . <EOS>	170.7719268798828

“ He brings an irreproachable name , which Maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the Legion of Honor. ” The old man signified that he recollected him . <EOS>	113.98711395263672
The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès , probably never to behold her again . <EOS>	97.13462829589844
Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men ; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d ’ Avrigny , for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , — “ He is mad ! ” But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight . <EOS>	104.39824676513672
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime. ” “ Remember , ” answered the abbé calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , “ it is your fault , not mine , that I do so . <EOS>	107.22563171386719
d ’ Épinay can not leave the drawing-room at present. ” “ It is at this moment , ” replied Barrois with the same firmness , “ that M.

There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower-beds ; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure . <EOS>	733.2861938476562
It must have been for his hide , for , _certes_ , the carcass is not worth eighteen livres . <EOS>	174.54603576660156

There ! ” “ Let us dine , then , ” said Porthos ; “ it is getting cold. ” The friends , at ease with regard to the future , did honor to the repast , the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton , Bazin , Planchet , and Grimaud . <EOS>	53.02347946166992

I sank on my knees , my hands clasped round one of the bedposts ; then I felt that I was lost. ” Felton became frightfully pale , and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body . <EOS>	99.92355346679688

“ Father , ” said Mercédès , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table , “ sit , I pray you , on my right hand ; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , ” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand ; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart . <EOS>	129.00096130371094
No ; how would you have me know ? ” Parry bent his head and whispered to the king : “ It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends. ” “ Raising my scaffold ! ” cried the king , astounded . <EOS>	47.69411849975586

It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every instant . <EOS>	87.84262084960938
There he saw the grand-marshal , who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris , whose name I could not extract from him ; but this mission was to prepare men ’ s minds for a return ( it is the man who says this , sire ) —a return which will soon occur. ” “ And where is this man ? ” “ In prison , sire. ” “ And the matter seems serious to you ? ” “ So serious , sire , that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival , on the very day of my betrothal , I left my bride and friends , postponing everything , that I might hasten to lay at your majesty ’ s feet the fears which impressed me , and the assurance of my devotion. ” “ True , ” said Louis XVIII. , “ was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Daughter of one of your majesty ’ s most faithful servants. ” “ Yes , yes ; but let us talk of this plot , M. de Villefort. ” “ Sire , I fear it is more than a plot ; I fear it is a conspiracy. ” “ A conspiracy in these times , ” said Louis XVIII. , smiling , “ is a thing very easy to meditate , but more difficult to conduct to an end , inasmuch as , re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future . <EOS>	108.14981842041016

But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor . <EOS>	126.4472427368164
But what do I see in the water—something struggling ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” exclaimed Raoul , fixing his glance on one point in the stream , splendidly illumined by the setting sun , “ a horse , a rider ! ” “ They are sinking ! ” cried Olivain in his turn . <EOS>	55.72663497924805
He could already see the intendant ’ s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief . <EOS>	568.6556396484375
“ And Bazin ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	10.392010688781738
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows . <EOS>	378.77398681640625

It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them ; I saw him strolling about here this morning . <EOS>	330.5469970703125
“ That will serve us for a relay , ” said Athos . <EOS>	28.652400970458984
D ’ Artagnan then thought of that cottage , silent and obscure , which had no doubt seen all , and could tell its tale . <EOS>	97.64537048339844
The sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and I am to speak. ” “ Go , then , and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence , ” replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling . <EOS>	52.58097839355469

He followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees . <EOS>	122.74559783935547
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow . <EOS>	95.4688720703125
D ’ Artagnan reassured her as well as he could , and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Milady . <EOS>	49.764835357666016
No , happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father ’ s actions . <EOS>	331.03594970703125
“ This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself , ” said Milady , replacing the glass upon the table , with an infernal smile , “ but , my faith ! <EOS>	32.08229064941406
MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD On the day after these events had taken place , Athos not having reappeared , M. de Tréville was informed by D ’ Artagnan and Porthos of the circumstance . <EOS>	78.88909149169922
The woman screamed , and cried for help ; but her cries were soon stifled . <EOS>	116.68389892578125
Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me , and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require. ” This manner of acting roused much respect for D ’ Artagnan ’ s policy among the Musketeers . <EOS>	137.02601623535156
D ’ Artagnan was too grand to promise anything ; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name . <EOS>	82.85877227783203

We must confess these three strange names struck us ; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms , under which D ’ Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious , or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which , from caprice , discontent , or want of fortune , they had donned the simple Musketeer ’ s uniform . <EOS>	266.4645690917969

Totally disregarding the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman , aided by a powerful opera-glass ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing , were all so much engrossed with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass . <EOS>	220.52969360351562

They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant Adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . <EOS>	730.4915161132812

“ Now , then , to breakfast , ” said Beauchamp ; “ for , if I remember , you told me you only expected two persons , Albert. ” “ Morrel , ” muttered Albert— “ Morrel—who is he ? ” But before he had finished , M. de Château-Renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , —that is , with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemart , —took Albert ’ s hand . <EOS>	103.27116394042969

“ You will , I trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you , ” he said , “ but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people. ” “ So much so , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count. ” “ Upon my word , monsieur , ” said Danglars with affected carelessness , “ I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions ; but the fact is , I was made baron , and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor , in return for services rendered , but—— ” “ But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette ? <EOS>	118.01109313964844

And yet it is very hard , ” added she , “ that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend , treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies. ” “ That is because your fancies go too far , ” replied the triumphant Bonacieux , “ and I mistrust them. ” “ Well , I will give it up , then , ” said the young woman , sighing . <EOS>	64.87754821777344

But he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen ’ s carriage had left the court . <EOS>	74.12301635742188

“ Yes , yes , ” replied he , “ I perceive that plainly ; but do you really believe it is she ? ” “ I am sure of it. ” “ Nevertheless , I confess I still doubt. ” “ But the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder ? ” “ She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France , and has been branded in consequence. ” “ Athos , she is your wife , I tell you , ” repeated D ’ Artagnan ; “ only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other. ” “ Yes ; but I should think the other must be dead , I hanged her so effectually. ” It was D ’ Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn . <EOS>	44.526695251464844

Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity . <EOS>	282.0256042480469
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth , who am neglected and forgotten by my father , harassed and persecuted by my stepmother , and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man , whose withered hand can no longer press mine , and who can speak to me with the eye alone , although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild . <EOS>	251.1111297607422

They will know you are deserted , and think you also poor , for I alone know your real financial position , and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner. ” The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this , was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken . <EOS>	210.169677734375
IN FRANCE The first fear of the King of England , Charles I. , on learning of the death of the duke , was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais ; he tried , says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_ , to conceal it from them as long as possible , closing all the ports of his kingdom , and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone , taking upon himself , in default of Buckingham , to superintend the departure . <EOS>	208.92855834960938

The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear , since the people had nothing more just then to ask for . <EOS>	100.8762435913086
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy , pale , and threatening countenance of Fernand , as it was defined in the shadow . <EOS>	88.18377685546875
At length , about the hour the governor had appointed , footsteps were heard on the stairs . <EOS>	66.77117919921875
He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field . <EOS>	144.19253540039062
“ Now I am alone , my dear Athos , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ open the door , I beg of you. ” “ Instantly , ” said Athos . <EOS>	11.032166481018066
“ There are several branches of the D ’ Artagnans at Tarbes and in its environs , ” said the cardinal ; “ to which do you belong ? ” “ I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry , the father of his gracious Majesty. ” “ That is well . <EOS>	128.41957092285156
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him , and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss . <EOS>	78.42371368408203
He then went straight to the door and knocked , murmuring , “ I will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap , but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse ! ” The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and D ’ Artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux , the door of which , doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him . <EOS>	90.38694763183594
This was Julie , who had become , as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted , Madame Emmanuel Herbault . <EOS>	84.2275619506836
will you let me be killed ? <EOS>	33.762107849121094
Now , as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time , each becoming , naturally , more firm in his own opinion , M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly . <EOS>	208.7586669921875
Please follow me , ” and he went on before , followed by Athos and Aramis . <EOS>	46.35551071166992
It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . <EOS>	63.292755126953125
On opening the door , Villefort found himself facing him , and the young magistrate ’ s first impulse was to pause . <EOS>	84.283447265625
Then they were both silent . <EOS>	69.8953628540039
“ A thousand pardons , gentlemen ; but no doubt this man brings me the news I expected. ” And rising also , he went off at a quick pace . <EOS>	66.8336410522461
Ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my images , three francs each . <EOS>	145.29428100585938
She had profited by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for Paris , and had reclaimed it . <EOS>	117.5474853515625
Well , sir , you ought to know that we no longer have a police , since we are no longer at Paris. ” “ I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are , but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections. ” “ But , God forgive me ! ” cried Anne , with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her , “ I believe that you are yourself interrogating. ” “ Yes , madame , here I have a right to do so , for it concerns Monsieur d ’ Artagnan—-d ’ Artagnan , ” he repeated , in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman . <EOS>	84.2789077758789
The prince read as he hastened on . <EOS>	74.60334014892578
Ah , that would indeed be infamous. ” “ How did Danglars usually write ? ” “ In a handsome , running hand. ” “ And how was the anonymous letter written ? ” “ Backhanded. ” Again the abbé smiled . <EOS>	122.7273941040039
“ I then swore that this woman who had ruined him , who was more than his accomplice , since she had urged him to the crime , should at least share his punishment . <EOS>	71.877197265625
Now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? —that which we do not understand . <EOS>	74.0006103515625
for I think you told me it was a boy , M. Bertuccio. ” “ No excellency , I do not recollect telling you that. ” “ I thought you did ; I must have been mistaken. ” “ No , you were not , for it was in reality a little boy . <EOS>	66.22582244873047

“ Yes , ” said he . <EOS>	6.1156110763549805
“ My lord , you are right , and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last . <EOS>	19.780500411987305
“ Oh , those Villeforts are an accursed race ! ” “ Truly they are , ” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone . <EOS>	89.16499328613281
“ But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , his eyes aflame , “ battle ! <EOS>	37.82816696166992
“ I entreat you—— ” continued Villefort . <EOS>	47.73170471191406
One thing , however , reassured him ; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off , and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders . <EOS>	63.01321029663086
“ Friend , ” said he , “ for Athos this is too much ; for the Comte de la Fère it is too little . <EOS>	24.02863883972168
That he has given the diamond to us only ? ” inquired Caderousse , half bewildered with joy ; “ yes , nothing more true ! <EOS>	63.64154052734375
“ Oh , madame , I do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times I am your most respectful servant. ” The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes . <EOS>	57.350547790527344
“ Decidedly , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , you are the man I have been seeking . <EOS>	20.053348541259766
They advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again . <EOS>	53.45290756225586
“ Yes , you were thinking of it , and with justice . <EOS>	26.33845329284668
“ Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ? ” “ Ah ! <EOS>	70.28190612792969
It was thus with Milady . <EOS>	62.808563232421875
The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords , and returned them to their sheaths . <EOS>	163.59954833984375
I mean the Russian prince , who you said had 30,000 livres , and we only found 22,000. ” “ You must have searched badly. ” “ Luigi Vampa himself searched. ” “ In that case he must either have paid his debts—— ” “ A Russian do that ? ” “ Or spent the money ? ” “ Possibly , after all. ” “ Certainly . <EOS>	212.91261291503906
Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons ; Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands , Athos with his sword in his scabbard , his pistol in his saddle-bags ; calm and cool as if on the parade , except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes . <EOS>	141.23243713378906
Grimaud , meantime , undid the means of escape . <EOS>	140.85997009277344
Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides , without effect ; sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth . <EOS>	1071.56640625
At length Providence has done something for you ; he restores to you more than he takes away , and it was time I should die. ” Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim , “ Oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! ” and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , “ Oh , I have saved you once , and I will save you a second time ! ” And raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor . <EOS>	65.32947540283203
All the same , I should like to do him that service—what do you say to it ? ” “ I will tell the coadjutor , ” said Bazin . <EOS>	37.683509826660156

D ’ Artagnan took leave of Milady , and left the saloon the happiest of men . <EOS>	54.58538055419922
“ Sir , ” interposed Blaisois , “ I warn you that I can only swim in rivers. ” “ And I not at all , ” said Mousqueton . <EOS>	21.18330955505371
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche . <EOS>	177.08900451660156
“ Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation. ” “ Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and I have noticed that—— ” “ What ? ” “ That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform. ” “ You have evidently seen and observed everything. ” “ Let us proceed. ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Now as regards the second question. ” “ I am listening. ” “ Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès ? ” “ Yes ; a young man who loved her. ” “ And his name was—— ” “ Fernand. ” “ That is a Spanish name , I think ? ” “ He was a Catalan. ” “ You imagine him capable of writing the letter ? ” “ Oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me. ” “ That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never. ” “ Besides , ” said Dantès , “ the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him. ” “ You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? ” “ To no one. ” “ Not even to your mistress ? ” “ No , not even to my betrothed. ” “ Then it is Danglars. ” “ I feel quite sure of it now. ” “ Wait a little . <EOS>	118.47247314453125
He now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , dishevelled hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes , —someone by whose side he might weep . <EOS>	152.19908142089844
Cloud sounded half past ten . <EOS>	2048.758056640625
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment ; then , as if appearing to have formed a resolution , she said , “ I have an enemy. ” “ You , madame ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , affecting surprise ; “ is that possible , my God ? —good and beautiful as you are ! ” “ A mortal enemy. ” “ Indeed ! ” “ An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death . <EOS>	54.04191207885742
But he had scarcely left before Danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24 exclaimed : “ Fool ! ” Then enclosing Monte Cristo ’ s receipt in a little pocket-book , he added : — “ Yes , come at twelve o ’ clock ; I shall then be far away. ” Then he double-locked his door , emptied all his drawers , collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes , burned several papers , left others exposed to view , and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed : “ To Madame la Baronne Danglars. ” “ I will place it on her table myself tonight , ” he murmured . <EOS>	230.416259765625
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress , and always thickly veiled ; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot . <EOS>	205.43780517578125

Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures , united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love , had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another , and economizing their stores , and Albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance : “ Mother , we have no more money. ” 50141m Mercédès had never known misery ; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those synonymous words , there is a wide difference . <EOS>	342.3663024902344
“ Certainly ; his panegyric has been uttered. ” They parted , laughing , she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest , he looking after her with eyes of love . <EOS>	258.4798278808594
This smile appeared to D ’ Artagnan to be of bad augury . <EOS>	55.4741325378418
“ Maximilian , Maximilian , ” he said , “ the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian. ” “ Oh , do not fear , my friend , ” said Morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count ; “ I shall no longer attempt my life. ” “ Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair ? ” “ No ; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife. ” “ Poor fellow , what is it ? ” “ My grief will kill me of itself. ” “ My friend , ” said Monte Cristo , with an expression of melancholy equal to his own , “ listen to me . <EOS>	33.97718811035156
The lackeys followed . <EOS>	57.24435043334961
These gentlemen , ” added he , turning to the two friends , “ will , I trust , do me the honor to breakfast with me ? ” “ But , my dear count , ” said Albert , “ we shall abuse your kindness. ” “ Not at all ; on the contrary , you will give me great pleasure . <EOS>	23.99616050720215
he has neither robbed , nor killed , nor murdered. ” “ Hold your tongue ! ” said Danglars . <EOS>	60.212467193603516
“ No , ” replied Mousqueton , “ Parry kept it . <EOS>	30.33573341369629
Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence ? ” “ Not the slightest , but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences. ” “ But who perpetrated that joke , let me ask ? <EOS>	145.8839569091797
“ But , ” cried Felton , “ that is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there. ” “ And therein consisted the infamy , ” replied Milady . <EOS>	41.303558349609375

Ah , since the dangers I incur on my own account can not stop you , think of those you may yourself run ! ” “ Me ? ” “ Yes ; there is peril of imprisonment , risk of life in knowing me. ” “ Then I will not leave you. ” “ Monsieur ! ” said the young woman , supplicating him and clasping her hands together , “ monsieur , in the name of heaven , by the honor of a soldier , by the courtesy of a gentleman , depart ! <EOS>	59.10661315917969
The more we have ventured the more we gain , when we know how to wait. ” “ Yes ; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners. ” “ Bah ! ” said Athos . <EOS>	82.0990982055664
“ There , ” said the king , looking at a clock , “ there , now , as it is half past eight , you may retire ; for as I told you , I expect someone at nine . <EOS>	33.420257568359375

But in fifteen days , as you know , or as you do not know , this fatal campaign is to open . <EOS>	70.7012939453125
Morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon . <EOS>	60.256900787353516
“ Madame Bonacieux ! ” murmured D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	6.966017723083496

Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger , the queen , when his death was announced to her , would not believe the fact , and even imprudently exclaimed , “ it is false ; he has just written to me ! ” But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence ; Laporte , detained in England , as everyone else had been , by the orders of Charles I. , arrived , and was the bearer of the duke ’ s dying gift to the queen . <EOS>	72.72502136230469

His secret , then , was in the past , as had often been vaguely said to D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	56.7178955078125
One day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of firearms , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks , and hurried towards them . <EOS>	78.49385833740234

“ Was not your father a Bonapartist ? ” asked Monte Cristo ; “ I think I remember that you told me something of that kind. ” “ My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else , ” said Villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; “ and the senator ’ s robe , which Napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him . <EOS>	71.71495819091797

“ I was not deceived , ” said he ; “ here is Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ; and you are his friends , Messieurs Athos , Porthos , and Aramis. ” The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment . <EOS>	30.527545928955078
“ Athos , my friend ! ” And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other ’ s arms ; then Athos , looking into his friend ’ s face and taking him by both hands , said : “ What ails you , my lord ? <EOS>	36.13209533691406

He felt a slight disappointment , however , when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton , and when Porthos signified to him that the state of his household , though great , would not support two servants , and that he must enter into the service of D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	73.39347076416016
But this time , instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse , and advanced to meet D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	45.344608306884766
A kind of steward appeared , just as D ’ Artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount . <EOS>	54.22406005859375
Besides—do you see that door , Athos ? ” “ Yes ; what then ? ” “ Well , you can go out by that door whenever you please ; for from this moment you are free as the air. ” “ I recognize you there , my brave D ’ Artagnan , ” replied Athos ; “ but you are no longer our masters . <EOS>	44.862464904785156
“ It is very hot , ” said Athos , drawing his sword in its turn , “ and yet I can not take off my doublet ; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed again , and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself. ” “ That is true , Monsieur , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ and whether drawn by myself or another , I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman . <EOS>	56.601585388183594

“ Well , ” cried his auditors ; “ at the moment you left his house ? ” Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat . <EOS>	67.90972137451172

The commissary then , instead of continuing to interrogate him , made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters . <EOS>	202.82559204101562
Many observations were made , the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room . <EOS>	473.9830017089844

“ Count , ” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance , “ there is a beautiful Arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof. ” “ I know it , madame , ” replied the count ; “ but we are in France , and not in Arabia , and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another. ” “ But , ” said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , “ we are friends , are we not ? ” The count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson ; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled . <EOS>	91.9963607788086
Franz was too far off to hear what they said ; but , without doubt , nothing hostile passed , for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the peasant girl . <EOS>	159.29364013671875
All that , however , has nothing to do with my obligations to you , and I now come to ask you whether , in my own person , my family , or connections , I can in any way serve you ? <EOS>	68.29596710205078

Fortunately , the reader may remember , or may not remember—fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him . <EOS>	142.92156982421875
Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization , and he had brought him away without any other recommendation . <EOS>	138.6211395263672

Bonacieux ; “ therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others—that is quite another thing. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine. ” “ Beware of what you do ! ” cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make D ’ Artagnan start in spite of himself . <EOS>	45.567623138427734

“ But if it is a woman who writes , ” said Aramis , “ and that woman desires not to be seen , remember , you compromise her , D ’ Artagnan ; which is not the part of a gentleman. ” “ We will remain in the background , ” said Porthos , “ and he will advance alone. ” “ Yes ; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop. ” “ Bah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ they will miss me ; if they fire we will ride after the carriage , and exterminate those who may be in it . <EOS>	50.92744827270508

For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife , with two servants , —a chambermaid named Trinette , and a hostler called Pecaud . <EOS>	355.0784606933594

He then arose . <EOS>	78.60353088378906
Do you think it is worth while ? ” said Villefort . <EOS>	40.61502456665039
That was a noble example to follow , monsieur. ” “ Why , ” replied Danglars , “ not entirely so ; with the servants , —you understand. ” “ I see ; to your domestics you are ‘ my lord , ’ the journalists style you ‘ monsieur , ’ while your constituents call you ‘ citizen. ’ These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government . <EOS>	241.31106567382812
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal ’ s death as a deliverance ; and I , even I , opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand . <EOS>	160.70590209960938
“ Ah , Danglars ! ” whispered Caderousse , “ you have deceived me—the trick you spoke of last night has been played ; but I can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault . <EOS>	126.69517517089844
’ Twas too brief an enjoyment , and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health ( of which it was perhaps rather the result ) would not long survive such a mode of life . <EOS>	170.376220703125
“ Not a step forward , or you ’ re dead men. ” “ Stuff ! ” cried Porthos , almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit . <EOS>	208.62074279785156
And you really mean to say ; monsieur , that my dear father is here ? ” “ Yes , sir ; and I can even add that I have only just left his company . <EOS>	33.751773834228516
She had raised her veil , and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son . <EOS>	86.20999908447266
The captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel ; so I took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then I jumped after him . <EOS>	51.779178619384766
He took his army to the priest ’ s , where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months , and to the cornet ’ s , who performed wonders ; but as Planchet said , “ People do not eat at once for all time , even when they eat a good deal. ” D ’ Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest ’ s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis had procured him . <EOS>	170.75701904296875
In this garden Mercédès had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously . <EOS>	158.3956298828125
“ Alas ! <EOS>	17.432788848876953

They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole day . <EOS>	117.33434295654297
Come , I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold. ” Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around ; indeed , Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid , or uttering a word . <EOS>	82.284912109375
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation . <EOS>	65.08024597167969
I only ask you a simple question ; answer it ; —that is all I require. ” “ I love a young girl , count. ” “ Do you love her much ? ” “ More than my life. ” “ Another hope defeated ! ” said the count . <EOS>	56.76399612426758
“ Have you not let it go out of your hands ? ” “ No. ” D ’ Avrigny took the bottle , poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand , and swallowed them . <EOS>	44.59125518798828
Where are your passports ? ” “ We have none ; we left England , ignorant of the state of politics here , having left Paris before the departure of the king. ” “ Ah ! ” said the sergeant , with a cunning smile , “ you are Mazarinists , who are sent as spies. ” “ My dear friend , ” here Athos spoke , “ rest assured , if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport . <EOS>	68.76200866699219
“ Let us speak of my affairs , ” said Mazarin , “ since you will tell me naught of yours . <EOS>	27.54708480834961
In truth , in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers . <EOS>	109.66749572753906
The host insisted ; but the travelers were firm , and he was obliged to do as they wished . <EOS>	57.93086624145508
When he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , pried open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the phial contained , perhaps , twice as much more . <EOS>	166.82594299316406
Franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him ( Franz ) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so . <EOS>	200.38853454589844
Meantime , Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke . <EOS>	277.4980773925781
“ How long a start have they ? ” “ Two hours and a quarter , my officer. ” “ Two hours and a quarter—that is nothing ; we are well mounted , are we not , Porthos ? ” Porthos breathed a sigh ; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses . <EOS>	101.03809356689453
Well , I take you with me ; we conceal ourselves , and wait together. ” “ But I shall not be allowed to go ; I am almost a prisoner. ” “ As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal , no one will believe you anxious to follow me. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well ! <EOS>	46.16971206665039
The cardinal was , as we have said , in very low spirits ; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others . <EOS>	85.98292541503906
The count ’ s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man . <EOS>	89.68222045898438
( “ He were a dead man ” said the Gascon , “ if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment ; but for my part , before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once ; the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me. ” “ Hush ! ” said Porthos ; “ listen. ” ) “ Madame , ” cried the cardinal , seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back , “ Madame , what are you about ? ” Then he added in Spanish , “ Anne , are you mad ? <EOS>	74.03195190429688
“ No , thank you. ” “ Do you wish anything ? ” “ Leave me to pray. ” The count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel , who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees , and turned towards Paris , without once looking back . <EOS>	64.39989471435547
No , I feel that I have reached the goal , and I will go no farther . <EOS>	31.614734649658203
So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city , and in half an hour ’ s time he stopped before a little isolated house . <EOS>	65.18524932861328
“ We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand , —a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter. ” “ Oh , ” cried Julie , “ I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand , as I now kiss the purse which he has touched . <EOS>	155.314208984375
I raised my head ; I was in utter darkness . <EOS>	55.44752883911133
Midnight struck . <EOS>	7226.64697265625
Who will support them ? ” A shudder ran through the young man ’ s frame . <EOS>	52.90412521362305
“ I feared it , Maximilian , ” said she ; “ it is the counsel of a madman , and I should be more mad than you , did I not stop you at once with the word ‘ Impossible , Morrel , impossible ! ’ ” “ You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it ? ” said Morrel sorrowfully . <EOS>	60.573875427246094
But you remind me . <EOS>	73.89704895019531
The men I have put to flight will return reinforced ; if they find us here , we are lost . <EOS>	118.51145935058594
Well , my friend , nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow. ” “ Hush ! ” said Athos , putting a finger on his lips , with the sad smile peculiar to him ; “ let us talk no more of Mordaunt—it will bring bad luck. ” And Athos set forward toward Charenton , followed closely by Aramis . <EOS>	98.29045104980469
“ She is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress. ” Noirtier again closed his left eye . <EOS>	80.5655746459961
Shall I send the father to you ? ” “ Immediately. ” “ Very well. ” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars ’ contempt , Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker ’ s wife should exercise in providing for the future . <EOS>	90.80641174316406
D ’ Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it . <EOS>	42.603763580322266
he escapes us. ” “ So much the better , ” muttered Athos . <EOS>	23.129955291748047
Then there is his son , Andrea , a charming young man , about your own age , viscount , bearing the same title as yourself , and who is making his entry into the Parisian world , aided by his father ’ s millions . <EOS>	95.76372528076172
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin , who paid them numerous compliments , and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired , namely , D ’ Artagnan his captaincy , Porthos his barony . <EOS>	134.11355590820312
Wasn ’ t I right to part with the horses ? ” Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt . <EOS>	158.74057006835938
He looked around him and saw Mme . <EOS>	40.447288513183594
The lady was surpassingly beautiful , while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her . <EOS>	183.11964416503906
“ Now we are alone , dear Aramis , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchet ’ s horse. ” “ I ’ faith ! ” answered Aramis , “ as you see , from Heaven. ” “ From Heaven , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , shaking his head ; “ you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there. ” “ My friend , ” said Aramis , with a look of imbecility on his face which D ’ Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers , “ if I did not come from Heaven , at least I was leaving Paradise , which is almost the same. ” “ Here , then , is a puzzle for the learned , ” observed D ’ Artagnan , “ until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise ; some place it on Mount Ararat , others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates ; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it , while it was actually very near . <EOS>	62.96857833862305

A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure , entered , and joined the Musketeers . <EOS>	82.16610717773438
Four marble steps led down to the water ’ s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide . <EOS>	187.8566436767578
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists ; there were landscapes by Dupré , with their long reeds and tall trees , their lowing oxen and marvellous skies ; Delacroix ’ s Arabian cavaliers , with their long white burnouses , their shining belts , their damasked arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces ; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger , representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet ; there were paintings by Diaz , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his suns more brilliant than the sun ; designs by Decamp , as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa , but more poetic ; _pastels_ by Giraud and Müller , representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats ’ “ Travels in the East , ” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel , or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past . <EOS>	783.7212524414062
Now , then , what had I better do ? ” “ Return instantly . <EOS>	56.82390213012695
Not at all , prince , ” said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title , “ what have I done for you ? <EOS>	66.9452133178711
“ Well , I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars. ” “ I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head. ” “ What fortune has she ? ” “ But I tell you—— ” “ A million ? ” Andrea shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	49.214088439941406
The guards asked permission of La Ramee , who gave it to them , but not till the evening , however ; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone . <EOS>	54.469783782958984
All fell to their knees . <EOS>	121.73859405517578
“ Do I look so ? ” asked the baron , rising and going a step backward . <EOS>	41.067543029785156
“ And no one thinks of us in this country , for each must think about his own affairs . <EOS>	75.12560272216797
You must have much reason to complain of him. ” “ Not very much , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	19.563100814819336

But the voyage was not ended . <EOS>	153.5928955078125
The prisoners , therefore , had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors—which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts . <EOS>	172.60598754882812
If Richelieu made the king , by comparison , seem small , he made royalty great . <EOS>	432.9065246582031
“ But , for heaven ’ s sake— ” resumed Aramis . <EOS>	114.93707275390625

“ Well ! ” said Aramis . <EOS>	8.403570175170898
At the corner of the street they met the count ’ s steward , who was awaiting his master . <EOS>	19.824851989746094
And , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet , the count seemed to have the power of fascination . <EOS>	111.8009033203125
Attend to yourself ; answer me. ” Dantès waited , expecting a question , but in vain . <EOS>	116.97776794433594

D ’ Artagnan regained the trench , and threw the corpse beside the wounded man , who was as pale as death . <EOS>	30.740177154541016
In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar , which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them . <EOS>	96.55010986328125
“ Oh , as for that , I ’ ll take you to a splendid place , ” said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse ’ s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him . <EOS>	75.85944366455078
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast ; then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain , and drank it . <EOS>	283.5466003417969
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : “ Go on , I know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , God and I will judge. ” “ Oh , father , ” continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , “ it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river , that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature—the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave—united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , ‘ Place for the justice of God ! ’ ” “ Delirium ! ” murmured the monk , shaking his head . <EOS>	120.62866973876953
Vampa took Cucumetto ’ s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto , while in her turn Teresa remained outside . <EOS>	108.58076477050781
But pardon me , are you free ? <EOS>	59.544036865234375
“ Now I think of it , you can do better , ” said Danglars . <EOS>	18.789493560791016
As he departed , Danglars approached , and said , — “ Well , it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo ? ” “ Yes , most satisfactory , my dear Danglars. ” “ Well , so much the better , ” said the supercargo ; “ for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty. ” “ Dantès has done his , ” replied the owner , “ and that is not saying much . <EOS>	42.611900329589844
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions . <EOS>	141.807861328125
On rising , he went to his window , which opened on a terrace , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest . <EOS>	95.79190063476562
I can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars. ” 30107m “ Ah , ” said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , “ that may be easily explained ; the Comtesse de Morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough. ” “ I do not know if that is her reason , ” said Albert , “ but one thing I do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable . <EOS>	94.15895080566406
Eh , gentlemen , let us reckon upon accidents ! <EOS>	137.85452270507812
With forty-five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years , and comfortably for four ; but before six months—you with your music , and I with my voice—we shall double our capital . <EOS>	535.0432739257812
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count ’ s pistol . <EOS>	156.82252502441406
So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone . <EOS>	50.144622802734375
M. de Tréville listened to the young man ’ s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair . <EOS>	74.27565002441406
She is young ; she is beautiful ; she possesses all earthly seductions . <EOS>	283.09051513671875
Come to us this evening and to-morrow we ’ ll return your visit. ” “ Capital ! <EOS>	104.21998596191406
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry . <EOS>	200.0246124267578
D ’ Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn , and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it . <EOS>	85.49188995361328
He jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant ’ s arms , and joined them . <EOS>	29.879865646362305
“ Now , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I ’ ve one last favor to ask of you , Monsieur de Comminges. ” “ At your service , sir. ” “ You will see the count again ? ” “ To-morrow morning. ” “ Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained ? ” “ You want the cardinal to come here ? ” “ No ; I know my place and am not so presumptuous . <EOS>	34.99991226196289
“ Then the diamond is safe ? ” said he , timidly . <EOS>	21.022449493408203
Mercédès read with terror the following lines : “ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès , second in command on board the _Pharaon_ , this day arrived from Smyrna , after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo , is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper , and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris . <EOS>	114.64641571044922
Now this was a Sunday , and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him . <EOS>	103.74439239501953
“ Good-evening , comrade , ” said D ’ Artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner . <EOS>	54.353248596191406
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , — “ To the Island of Elba ! ” The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo . <EOS>	143.0161895751953
The mendicant hesitated at first , but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented , and walked on before Athos . <EOS>	70.06507873535156
He was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him ; this seemed a good augury . <EOS>	157.0237274169922
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man , wrapped in a large cloak . <EOS>	34.59435272216797
“ Yes—yes , ” said Caderousse ; “ but you were right to return as soon as possible , my boy. ” “ And why ? ” “ Because Mercédès is a very fine girl , and fine girls never lack followers ; she particularly has them by dozens. ” “ Really ? ” answered Edmond , with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness . <EOS>	76.21382141113281
‘ All hands to the pumps ! ’ I shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in . <EOS>	211.36746215820312
The two brigands looked at each other for a moment—the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow . <EOS>	72.03856658935547
‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo , who is now , I believe , in Paris ? ’ “ ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo , my foster-father , has been in Normandy the last three days. ’ “ ‘ Who , then , has counselled you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief . <EOS>	50.7961311340332
“ You smile. ” “ Yes. ” “ Why do you do so ? ” “ I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own . <EOS>	62.835792541503906
He found D ’ Artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante-room . <EOS>	51.56806564331055
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son . <EOS>	126.92942810058594
The house may be suspected ; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , for I can affirm , sire , if I can believe what he says , that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty , or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal. ” “ Was it not this D ’ Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day , in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Déchaussés ? ” asked the king , looking at the cardinal , who colored with vexation . <EOS>	83.59449768066406
She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English , who thereupon requested D ’ Artagnan ’ s permission to retire , excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away , and charging his sister to obtain his pardon . <EOS>	90.86146545410156
“ She is there , ” said he . <EOS>	9.75710391998291
“ One moment , yes , ” answered the queen . <EOS>	13.666284561157227
Nevertheless , knowing the weakness of her husband , and more particularly his cupidity , she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose . <EOS>	129.19241333007812
I have said what I have said. ” “ And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , in a low voice , “ I beg you to follow me. ” “ And when ? ” asked the Guardsman , with the same jeering air . <EOS>	21.033750534057617
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other . <EOS>	79.9674301147461
“ Why is that gendarme there ? ” asked Andrea of himself . <EOS>	40.77371597290039
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed . <EOS>	945.41455078125
my friend ! ” cried Athos , suddenly , “ where have you brought us ? <EOS>	28.83312225341797
You must have discovered a mine , or else become a stockbroker. ” “ So that , as you confess , you are jealous ? ” “ No , I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you ; but as I am not quite properly dressed , I chose my opportunity , that I might not compromise you. ” “ Yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! ” exclaimed Andrea ; “ you speak to me before my servant. ” “ How can I help that , my boy ? <EOS>	65.23239135742188
The assizes , also , were about to begin , and Villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse . <EOS>	126.18318176269531
A high wall , at the angle of which was the pavilion , ran along one side of this lane , and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers-by . <EOS>	112.1924057006836
D ’ Artagnan , who never turned his head , did not perceive it . <EOS>	17.007694244384766
“ Three , ” replied Aramis , smiling . <EOS>	11.034920692443848
to be sure , yes . <EOS>	23.175804138183594
M. Bonacieux was at his door . <EOS>	26.512359619140625
In an instant he was among the branches , and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion . <EOS>	86.17415618896484
What would the abbé please to have ? <EOS>	77.43749237060547
“ Ha , ha , ” said Château-Renaud , “ here come some friends of yours , viscount ! <EOS>	45.43269348144531
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	71.4964370727539
“ Oh ! <EOS>	14.116679191589355
“ Ah , my dear friend ! ” he cried , “ what bad stabling for my horses here. ” “ Indeed ! ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ I am most unhappy to hear it , on account of those fine animals. ” “ And I , also—I was also wretchedly off , ” he answered , moving backward and forward as he spoke ; “ and had it not been for the hostess , ” he added , with his air of vulgar self-complacency , “ who is very agreeable and understands a joke , I should have got a lodging elsewhere. ” The pretty Madeleine , who had approached during this colloquy , stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos ’ s words , for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated . <EOS>	93.4749526977539
His brain was on fire , and life and energy returned . <EOS>	241.09127807617188
“ What a devil of a face you have , Porthos ! <EOS>	58.71780014038086
After this second part of his discourse , fixing his hawk ’ s eye upon poor Bonacieux , he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation . <EOS>	184.79443359375
The chocolate was inoffensive , for M. de Villefort felt no effects . <EOS>	178.8802490234375
How D ’ Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw . <EOS>	173.11166381835938
D ’ Artagnan preferred the second means , and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired . <EOS>	131.6366424560547
As for Villefort , instead of sending to Paris , he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès , in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely , —that is , a second restoration . <EOS>	211.32553100585938
“ About half-past six. ” “ We will be with you at that time , ” said the major . <EOS>	33.07353973388672
“ If we release the prisoner thus , we shall never know the truth. ” “ Athos may always be found , ” replied Tréville , “ ready to answer , when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him . <EOS>	74.83671569824219
We have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord . <EOS>	215.371826171875
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered , Cromwell did not move . <EOS>	203.28250122070312
By degrees , the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them , and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel . <EOS>	111.89327239990234
“ As to Porthos , that is certainly droll ; but I am not the less a giddy fool . <EOS>	67.83712768554688
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment . <EOS>	859.4046630859375
“ Well , ” said Franz to him ; “ there is the beginning of an adventure. ” “ Laugh if you please—I really think so . <EOS>	68.78194427490234
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood. ” “ Did you see nothing there ? ” asked the count . <EOS>	35.96869659423828
A light yacht , chaste and elegant in its form , was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake , extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles , and from Tunis to Venice . <EOS>	370.2603759765625
50211m “ Madame , ” said the count , “ it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness , but I offer you consolation ; will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend ? ” “ I am , indeed , most wretched , ” replied Mercédès . <EOS>	43.684226989746094
“ Run ! <EOS>	25.324974060058594
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground . <EOS>	311.28289794921875
Coquenard , they arose slowly from the table , folded their napkins more slowly still , bowed , and retired . <EOS>	189.69700622558594
Do you not remember him ? ” “ Yes ! ” said Dantès , and without relinquishing Mercédès ’ hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air . <EOS>	74.68363952636719
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair . <EOS>	46.87957763671875
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege , but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating , we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded , to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal . <EOS>	99.75601959228516
“ Certainly , ” continued Danglars , “ the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned . <EOS>	62.77736282348633
As to Athos , he remained unmoved . <EOS>	36.86557388305664
He had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School , and left it as sub-lieutenant of the 53rd of the line . <EOS>	417.9972229003906
All at once he raised his head ; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution ; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten , and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him , he shrilled it twice . <EOS>	103.1989517211914
“ You have deceived me ! ” said the cardinal , sternly . <EOS>	14.834243774414062
“ Will these be in your way ? ” he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; “ if so , they can be tied up. ” Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman . <EOS>	89.87130737304688
Death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow . <EOS>	200.42800903320312
“ A prisoner has escaped from the Château d ’ If , and they are firing the alarm gun , ” replied Dantès . <EOS>	50.6463508605957
“ Wait , ” said Athos . <EOS>	7.124133586883545
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds . <EOS>	104.10773468017578
He then repaired to D ’ Artagnan , who , thanks to his four trusses of straw , was in the act of making up and tasting , by anticipation , the luxury of a bed so soft , so well stuffed at the head , so well covered at the foot , that it would have excited the envy of the king himself , if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own . <EOS>	82.45207214355469
“ Ah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to understand . <EOS>	8.669221878051758
Let us load the guns. ” The four Musketeers went to work ; and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready . <EOS>	136.26776123046875
yes—I should expect so ; besides , if they forget , I shall take the liberty of reminding them. ” “ The queen ’ s voice ! <EOS>	107.12020874023438
I was only speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just now. ” “ And with all this , how unassuming he is ! <EOS>	207.0055389404297
“ How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning ? ” “ All owing to your influence , ” replied Monte Cristo , smiling . <EOS>	40.424861907958984
The prince , Monsieur de Retz , the Duc de Beaufort , the Duc de Bouillon , are talking over public affairs . <EOS>	38.32646942138672
On this conviction I allow her to speculate , she having her bank and her stockbroker ; she speculated and lost . <EOS>	504.5842590332031
“ Good morning , Benedetto , ” said Bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice . <EOS>	47.6860237121582
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman. ” “ A gentleman ! ” exclaimed Athos . <EOS>	18.961406707763672
Milady was only a queen while among queens . <EOS>	244.59242248535156
“ Who are you , then ? ” cried all the witnesses of this scene . <EOS>	21.061931610107422
He arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room , saw Haydée , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back . <EOS>	75.52043914794922
In a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed . <EOS>	390.2802429199219
“ Repeat it ! <EOS>	53.31087112426758
The Englishmen , convinced of these peaceful proceedings , sheathed their swords grumblingly . <EOS>	413.1021728515625
if this man should ever discover the names of the others , my master is lost. ” “ Haste ! <EOS>	62.55686569213867
“ You see , ” said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to Faria , “ that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you . <EOS>	57.280147552490234
“ I have brought her here , sir , and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte , who , till better advice comes , has bathed the foot in cold well-water. ” The guests now all took leave of Athos , excepting the old Duc de Barbe , who , as an old friend of the family of La Valliere , went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage . <EOS>	170.7230682373047
Save me ! —I will not harm you. ” “ Andrea , the murderer ! ” cried one of the ladies . <EOS>	60.88203811645508
“ You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux . <EOS>	143.04940795898438
The queen saving us , her friends ; nothing more moral . <EOS>	264.87371826171875
It appears the conquerors had something else to do. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , we shall find their muskets , their cartridges , and their flasks ; and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls , we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire. ” “ Oh , Athos ! ” said Aramis , “ truly you are a great man. ” Porthos nodded in sign of agreement . <EOS>	81.09848022460938
Athos and D ’ Artagnan said nothing , but their silence seemed to imply consent . <EOS>	68.14109802246094
The next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again . <EOS>	19.9537296295166
Now , as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance , as one calls his other hand to aid the first , I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there ; for I had seen you , Aramis , with the king , and you , count , I knew would be under the scaffold , and for that reason I forgive you , ” he added , offering Athos his hand , “ for you must have suffered much . <EOS>	82.09921264648438
To horse , my friends , to horse ! ” And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Béthune . <EOS>	46.27656936645508
Well ? ” “ Having , then , a keeper like La Ramee , I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me , who would assist me in my flight. ” “ Come , come , ” said La Ramee , “ that ’ s not a bad idea. ” “ Capital , isn ’ t it ? <EOS>	37.17742156982422
“ Ah ! <EOS>	10.60301685333252
I know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune . <EOS>	35.042152404785156
Toxicology It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort ’ s for the purpose of returning the procureur ’ s visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion . <EOS>	39.27444076538086
You will take a biscuit with it , will you not ? ” “ Yes , I will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging. ” Monte Cristo rang ; Baptistin appeared . <EOS>	40.1046028137207
Laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep . <EOS>	48.99007797241211
Porthos came up behind , and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room . <EOS>	249.9823760986328
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . <EOS>	174.60031127929688
“ Scratches himself ? ” inquired the duke , “ what does your majesty mean ? ” “ Yes , indeed , my dear duke . <EOS>	26.957073211669922
Her face , as she looked at Athos , had taken on an expression that can not be described . <EOS>	63.230224609375
He was discovered ; all hope of flight was gone . <EOS>	139.61392211914062
Do you not see how she suffers ? ” Haydée answered with a heartrending expression , “ Why should he understand this , my sister ? <EOS>	82.89990997314453
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , “ I thought so ! ” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground . <EOS>	109.28724670410156
“ Come in , my lord , ” said Philip in a low tone , “ and I will show you something droll. ” Morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall . <EOS>	70.03324127197266
“ I shall want you this evening , ” he said “ Return in two hours. ” “ My lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I have an appointment in two hours which I can not miss. ” “ Do not be uneasy , ” said Mazarin ; “ it is the same. ” “ Good ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan ; “ I fancied it was so. ” “ Return , then , at five o ’ clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you . <EOS>	26.455291748046875

He pushed the door open and entered . <EOS>	56.82645034790039
“ Oh , ” said Aramis , “ I always try to be prepared ; and then I knew you were seeking me. ” “ From whom ? ” “ From Master Bazin , to be sure ; he took you for the devil , my dear fellow , and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers. ” “ Oh , monsieur ! ” said Bazin , clasping his hands supplicatingly . <EOS>	53.482173919677734
Without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay . <EOS>	95.59254455566406
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre , he turned to the left , galloped across the Carrousel , passed through the Rue Saint-Roch , and , issuing from the Rue de la Michodière , he arrived at M. Danglars ’ door just at the same time that Villefort ’ s landau , after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house . <EOS>	74.53290557861328
“ Question , then , my lord. ” “ Where did the army cross the Lys ? ” “ Between Saint-Venant and Aire. ” “ By whom is it commanded ? ” “ By Count de Fuonsaldagna , General Beck and the archduke. ” “ Of how many does it consist ? ” “ Eighteen thousand men and thirty-six cannon. ” “ And its aim is ? ” “ Lens. ” “ You see ; gentlemen ! ” said the prince , turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers . <EOS>	163.86764526367188
“ Your treasure ? ” stammered Dantès . <EOS>	29.796539306640625
More than that , we shall have a tempest , or I don ’ t know what ’ s what. ’ You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon ; luckily the captain understood his business . <EOS>	268.55731201171875
Breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone—she , a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared herself mentally to Judith , the terrible Jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke . <EOS>	486.8582458496094
Unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture . <EOS>	134.98365783691406
“ I shall be gone only a few moments. ” Villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace . <EOS>	180.0092010498047
After giving some directions to Ali , who stood in the lobby , the count took Albert ’ s arm . <EOS>	59.91403579711914
Madame de Villefort merely cried , “ Be still , Edward ! ” She then added , “ This young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty . <EOS>	126.61400604248047
Have you not heard that some one is coming here ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , that some one will open the doors. ” “ But , my dear fellow , if that some one recognizes us , if that some one cries out , we are lost ; for you don ’ t propose , I imagine , that I shall kill that man of the church . <EOS>	58.64065933227539
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves , whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles . <EOS>	600.2647705078125
we have a precious fellow here ! ” “ Monsieur Grimaud ! ” said the duke , “ for your sake I beg of you , never come within the reach of my fist ! ” “ Hush ! <EOS>	39.25687026977539
You have two unruly prisoners there , sir. ” “ Unruly , ” Comminges smiled ; “ you wish to terrify me , I suppose . <EOS>	109.6513900756836

His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter . <EOS>	83.306640625
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets , stuffs of the Levant , and cashmeres . <EOS>	282.8821716308594
“ Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them. ” “ Well , when Dantès was arrested , Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad . <EOS>	110.92742156982422
He wished to hasten their steps ; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own , and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend . <EOS>	52.75269317626953
_Ventre-saint-gris_ , Monsieur de Tréville , as the king my father would have said . <EOS>	84.37516784667969
The popular banker found that it answered better than count . <EOS>	332.5751037597656
The queen breathed more freely . <EOS>	103.72727966308594
In dying , I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron : ‘ _Eo rus_ , and all will be over. ’ But come , Franz , take courage , your wife is an heiress. ” “ Indeed , Beauchamp , you are unbearable . <EOS>	420.2966613769531
“ But , ” said Mazarin , “ you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen. ” “ The king and the queen are my king and queen , ” replied the musketeer , “ my life is theirs and I must give it for them . <EOS>	32.55185317993164
And all present , even including Cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man . <EOS>	150.22763061523438
Athos rose , and offering him his hand , “ Be welcome , my Lord , ” said he , “ you are one of us. ” “ I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth , ” said Lord de Winter . <EOS>	28.343481063842773
“ This communication , ” continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , “ will , we are sure , meet with your approbation. ” The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more . <EOS>	131.8956298828125
And you will tell him I will publish the report of Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru , upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade . <EOS>	198.23175048828125
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him . <EOS>	36.275390625
I beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish , too Italian , or too Arabian . <EOS>	152.9471893310547
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell , for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility . <EOS>	191.00375366210938
“ My friends , ” said Parry , mounting the scaffold and standing beside them , “ would you work a little more quietly ? <EOS>	84.71833038330078
She fainted . <EOS>	147.91119384765625

It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot. ” “ Wait , ” said Caderousse , “ we shall see. ” He then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off Cavalcanti ’ s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself . <EOS>	71.83711242675781
There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps , amusing themselves with the following exercise , while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport . <EOS>	138.5752716064453
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned . <EOS>	402.6070556640625
The cardinal envied that composure , which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger ; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself , that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage . <EOS>	286.81005859375
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin , who was running breathlessly . <EOS>	65.41828918457031
Besides , D ’ Artagnan has not told us his idea yet. ” And the Musketeer , with his usual coolness , reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast . <EOS>	60.01448059082031
“ You will not sign that order , my Lord ! ” said Felton , making a step toward the duke . <EOS>	31.771684646606445
“ You have asked for me ? ” said the Musketeer . <EOS>	10.949908256530762
Neither had any . <EOS>	520.3379516601562
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips , but rage in her heart . <EOS>	101.82937622070312
With such a _vade mecum_ D ’ Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait . <EOS>	943.7066650390625
“ I did not expect to see you again , ” said he feebly , to Dantès . <EOS>	31.137603759765625
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny ; we ’ ll have a supper here under your direction. ” “ Hum ! ” said La Ramee . <EOS>	82.37500762939453
“ You may guess , finding the luck turned , that I again staked the diamond. ” “ The devil ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , becoming angry again . <EOS>	72.39791107177734
“ Yes , he is a terrible antagonist . <EOS>	39.468441009521484
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX There was in all this , as may have been observed , one personage concerned , of whom , notwithstanding his precarious position , we have appeared to take but very little notice . <EOS>	214.07345581054688
I did not observe it yesterday. ” “ It must be the fog rising from the river , ” said the king . <EOS>	36.77571487426758

Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond . <EOS>	86.17678833007812
“ Half a million , ” said he , “ magnificent ! ” “ Half a million , is it ? ” said the major . <EOS>	25.607385635375977
And I have the same sincerity to show you , if you wish , Monsieur d ’ Herblay ; I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me. ” “ Really , monsieur , you say strange things , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	45.98011016845703
During this time , in the kiosk at my father ’ s feet , were seated twenty Palikares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats . <EOS>	152.808837890625
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person . <EOS>	157.81068420410156
Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d ’ Avrigny ’ s door . <EOS>	40.462188720703125
She wouldn ’ t believe me , saying that she knew Anne of Austria , who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb . <EOS>	87.8614730834961
Planchet , by way of dessert , would have liked to hear the conversation ; but the citizen declared to D ’ Artagnan that , what he had to say being important and confidential , he desired to be left alone with him . <EOS>	69.33988952636719
“ Just so. ” “ Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud ? ” The traveler made a sign of assent . <EOS>	32.941558837890625

Four men , disguised as workmen , were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich , where a vessel was waiting. ” “ And knowing all that , your honor remained here , far from the city , tranquil and inactive. ” “ Tranquil , yes , ” replied Cromwell . <EOS>	110.91234588623047

Valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every-day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body . <EOS>	267.5599365234375

When my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the Bourbons ; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountain , —theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result. ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ it is just as I thought ; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d ’ Épinay into personal contact . <EOS>	220.07504272460938

Aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room . <EOS>	134.5704345703125

I swear by— ” “ Don ’ t waste time in swearing , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ let us gallop , if our horses will consent. ” And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses ’ flanks , who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies . <EOS>	248.9232635498047
Did you see the president at the minister ’ s last night ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What did he say ? ” “ Something which will surprise you. ” “ Oh , make haste and tell me , then ; it is a long time since that has happened. ” “ Well , he told me that Benedetto , who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning , is really but a very commonplace , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death. ” “ Bah , ” said Beauchamp , “ he played the prince very well. ” “ Yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , Beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them ; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry. ” “ Then you never believed in the principality ? ” “ Yes.—in the principality , but not in the prince. ” “ Not so bad , ” said Beauchamp ; “ still , I assure you , he passed very well with many people ; I saw him at the ministers ’ houses. ” “ Ah , yes , ” said Château-Renaud . <EOS>	90.43109130859375
It would be , no doubt , _parbleu_ , if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance , of the horrors of the cardinal— ” “ Speak lower ! ” said Athos . <EOS>	105.03659057617188
The count , dismissing his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind . <EOS>	74.04077911376953
A small door , close to the lodge of the _concierge_ , gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot . <EOS>	178.8011016845703
All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day ; Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends—poor atoms , lost in that raging whirlwind . <EOS>	355.0161437988281

if I may ask without indiscretion. ” “ Near here , ” replied De Comminges , smiling ; “ so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are. ” “ He is wandering about the environs of the castle , ” thought D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	84.42632293701172
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing . <EOS>	273.0843811035156
He went straight to the queen , and in an altered voice said , “ Why , madame , have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs , when you know it would give me so much gratification ? ” The queen cast a glance around her , and saw the cardinal behind , with a diabolical smile on his countenance . <EOS>	52.69791030883789
“ Bring hither that horse. ” Friquet heard perfectly , but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road . <EOS>	134.94723510742188

“ Yes , ” replied the old man . <EOS>	5.973045825958252

“ ‘ Thou hast done well ! ’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice ; ‘ embrace me , my son. ’ 20115m Carlini threw himself , sobbing like a child , into the arms of his mistress ’ s father . <EOS>	79.24700164794922

D ’ Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils , and believed them to be buttoned ; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened , and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators , but even the actors themselves , laughed like so many madmen . <EOS>	172.20069885253906

Do you know about that institution ? ” “ I have heard of it. ” “ It is a magnificent charity. ” Having said this , the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies . <EOS>	97.7453384399414
At daybreak D ’ Artagnan entered the chamber , and demanded what was to be done . <EOS>	22.224803924560547
But we have not done with the thing yet. ” 0087m “ Do you , indeed , think so ? ” inquired the marquise . <EOS>	65.46412658691406
“ Look , ” said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , “ here is in this cup some syrup of violets , and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook . <EOS>	88.21624755859375

He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Milady ’ s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . <EOS>	83.91875457763672

At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal . <EOS>	32.915382385253906
“ Did the people shout at all ? ” Cromwell asked . <EOS>	66.65373229980469
By eight o ’ clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos . <EOS>	14.882173538208008
“ From that time he received all who came ; he had an excuse for not eating any more ; the doctor had put him on a diet. ” The abbé uttered a kind of groan . <EOS>	95.40547943115234
“ Take care , you are going to immure a traveller , Sinbad the Sailor , a man who comes to see Paris ; you are going to make a patriarch of him. ” 20255m “ Oh , no , ” said Morrel ; “ my sister is five-and-twenty , my brother-in-law is thirty , they are gay , young , and happy . <EOS>	85.09964752197266
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated Cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me. ” 0233m “ The physician may be mistaken ! ” exclaimed Dantès . <EOS>	254.54080200195312
Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history ; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner , and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep. ” Then , the count added aloud , “ Was his name ever known ? ” “ Oh , yes ; but only as No . <EOS>	179.5728302001953
He has taken part against his queen , or rather , against her minister . <EOS>	101.11453247070312
Give your orders , and we will execute them. ” “ Then open the door directly. ” Peppino obeyed . <EOS>	78.62992095947266
The third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life. ” “ No , no , ” cried Dantès ; “ you are mistaken—you will not die ! <EOS>	87.9035873413086
“ He gave no other name , ” answered Julie , looking earnestly at the count , “ than that at the end of his letter— ‘ Sinbad the Sailor. ’ ” “ Which is evidently not his real name , but a fictitious one. ” Then , noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice : “ Tell me , ” continued he , “ was he not about my height , perhaps a little taller , with his chin imprisoned , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely buttoned up , and constantly taking out his pencil ? ” “ Oh , do you then know him ? ” cried Julie , whose eyes sparkled with joy . <EOS>	88.36970520019531
D ’ Artagnan ran after her . <EOS>	22.276750564575195

He knew that it was barren and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to plunge into its waves again , and swim to Lemaire , equally arid , but larger , and consequently better adapted for concealment . <EOS>	330.243408203125

Morrel reddened , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him . <EOS>	78.394775390625
“ I believe so , ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	9.835026741027832
“ For two reasons. ” “ What ones ? ” “ The first is that my mistress will never love you. ” “ How do you know that ? ” “ You have cut her to the heart. ” “ I ? <EOS>	33.76815414428711
“ Ah , ah ! ” cried one of the Guards , “ will you persist in saying , most discreet Aramis , that you are not on good terms with Madame de Bois-Tracy , when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs ? ” Aramis darted at D ’ Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy . <EOS>	83.89678955078125
“ _Pardieu ! _ ” “ And what do they say of it in the world ? ” “ In which world ? <EOS>	21.77039337158203

“ Tell her grace , ” replied Athos , “ that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes. ” Then , with renewed instructions to Grimaud , Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment . <EOS>	85.62974548339844
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given , D ’ Artagnan put his horse into a gallop , and in a few strides overtook the carriage ; but the window was hermetically closed , the vision had disappeared . <EOS>	98.28988647460938
“ I should be delighted to do so , ” was the reply ; “ but if I am not mistaken , the words ‘ In haste , ’ are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought. ” “ You are right , ” said Du Tremblay . <EOS>	43.04058074951172

Bonacieux had also reflected ; but , it must be admitted , upon something widely different from ambition . <EOS>	306.1333923339844
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars , who had advanced to meet him . <EOS>	47.5072021484375
“ No , my friend , ” replied Athos , in his gentle but decided voice , “ we came here to defend King Charles ; we have but ill defended him—it remains for us to save him ! ” “ To save the king ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos . <EOS>	44.15889358520508

As a result she raised her head , opened her eyes , and sighed deeply . <EOS>	41.371070861816406
D ’ Artagnan flew to his hole , laid himself down on the floor at full length , and listened . <EOS>	40.462894439697266
“ Olivain ! ” he exclaimed , “ what do I see below there ? ” A second scream , more piercing than the first , now sounded . <EOS>	47.01228713989258
Then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months . <EOS>	111.14593505859375
All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct. ’ “ ‘ Monsieur , ’ I replied , ‘ it is not for myself that I entreat your interference—I should grieve for him or avenge him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would perish from want , for my brother ’ s pay alone kept her . <EOS>	181.28785705566406

The general remark is , ‘ Oh , it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters . <EOS>	277.8268127441406
“ And now you are assembled , gentlemen , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ permit me to offer you my apologies. ” At this word _apologies_ , a cloud passed over the brow of Athos , a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos , and a negative sign was the reply of Aramis . <EOS>	67.67852020263672
Am I deceived ? <EOS>	739.8049926757812

And the Greek princess , —will she be here ? ” “ No , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count ’ s establishment is not sufficiently understood. ” “ Wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to Madame de Villefort , who is trying to attract your attention. ” Albert bowed to Madame Danglars , and advanced towards Madame de Villefort , whose lips opened as he approached . <EOS>	61.0095329284668

“ We are alone , sir , ” said Buckingham ; “ speak ! ” “ My Lord , ” said Felton , “ the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson. ” “ Yes , sir ; and I answered him , to bring or send me that order and I would sign it. ” “ Here it is , my Lord. ” “ Give it to me , ” said the duke . <EOS>	38.44255828857422

D ’ Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many ; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position , like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him . <EOS>	93.50312805175781

Thinking of all this , and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse , D ’ Artagnan completed his short journey , and arrived at St. Germain . <EOS>	89.31473541259766

The friendship which united these four men , and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day , whether for dueling , business , or pleasure , caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows ; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another , from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice , or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg . <EOS>	135.40591430664062

An hour had passed since the sun had set , when Franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . <EOS>	136.49713134765625

During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state , Valentine ’ s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man ’ s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted . <EOS>	228.71463012695312

What is your name , in your turn , if you please ? ” “ D ’ Artagnan. ” “ To yours , monsieur. ” “ And above all others , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , as if carried away by his enthusiasm , “ to that of the king and the cardinal. ” The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of D ’ Artagnan if the wine had been bad ; but the wine was good , and he was convinced . <EOS>	36.8676643371582
He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard , and followed him , crying , “ Turn , turn , Master Joker , lest I strike you behind ! ” “ Strike me ! ” said the other , turning on his heels , and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt . <EOS>	108.64700317382812

“ Touch nothing , my little friend , ” cried the count eagerly ; “ some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste , but even to inhale. ” Madame de Villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son ’ s arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count . <EOS>	81.00410461425781

“ I am twenty-one years old , or rather I shall be in a few days , as I was born the night of the 27th of September , 1817. ” M. de Villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date . <EOS>	59.6007080078125

“ I understand the nature of your alarms , madame , ” said the count , carefully examining the child , “ but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least injury ; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass. ” “ Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears ? <EOS>	75.74424743652344

“ Who is this young person , M. de Morcerf ? ” inquired Eugénie ; “ does anybody know ? ” “ Mademoiselle , ” said Albert , replying to this direct appeal , “ I can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing—the young woman is a Greek. ” “ So I should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as well-informed as yourself. ” “ I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_ , ” replied Morcerf , “ but I am reluctantly obliged to confess , I have nothing further to communicate—yes , stay , I do know one thing more , namely , that she is a musician , for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count , I heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own. ” “ Then your count entertains visitors , does he ? ” asked Madame Danglars . <EOS>	112.39834594726562
I hope that you will sometimes , too , think of me , and if at certain hours you should miss me , if you should feel any slight regret at my absence , I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself , and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you. ” After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him , whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper , a mute and touching caress , which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter . <EOS>	109.6421890258789
During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army , and made a fortune ; then with that money he speculated in the funds , and trebled or quadrupled his capital ; and , having first married his banker ’ s daughter , who left him a widower , he has married a second time , a widow , a Madame de Nargonne , daughter of M. de Servieux , the king ’ s chamberlain , who is in high favor at court . <EOS>	165.86846923828125

Do you think he would recollect you ? ” “ My faith , monsieur , he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me. ” “ Well , go and talk with the boy , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead. ” Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin , who did not at all remember him , and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible ; while D ’ Artagnan turned the two horses into a lane , went round the house , and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts . <EOS>	65.39707946777344

“ But , madame , ” replied the count , continuing the conversation , and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine , “ have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ? <EOS>	47.75267028808594
“ Swear , then , ” said Villefort , joining the hands of Morrel and d ’ Avrigny , “ swear that you will spare the honor of my house , and leave me to avenge my child. ” D ’ Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “ Yes , ” but Morrel , disengaging his hand , rushed to the bed , and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own , hurriedly left , uttering a long , deep groan of despair and anguish . <EOS>	62.143428802490234

Then , turning to Ali , she directed him to bring coffee and pipes , and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her . <EOS>	97.48983764648438

I not only permit , I desire ; let them come in. ” The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince . <EOS>	81.90483856201172
“ Gentlemen , ” resumed Aramis , “ any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrested—for we have friends in Paris—but we are contented with another course . <EOS>	110.2549057006836
“ Don ’ t laugh , my friend ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ for heaven ’ s sake , don ’ t laugh , for upon my soul , it ’ s no laughing matter ! ” And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror , that Athos eagerly seized his hand , crying , “ Are you wounded , my friend ? <EOS>	38.08443832397461
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution . <EOS>	65.1935806274414
It was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking ; a death without agony , a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine ’ s name and pressing your hand. ” “ Yes , you have guessed rightly , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that is what I intended. ” “ Thanks ; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart. ” “ Do you then regret nothing ? ” “ No , ” replied Morrel . <EOS>	68.81527709960938

“ Adieu , Raoul , ” said the count ; “ adieu , my dearest boy ! ” “ Adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector. ” Athos waved his hand—he dared not trust himself to speak : and Raoul went away , his head uncovered . <EOS>	68.20445251464844
“ Do you , perchance , think I set any great store by life ? ” “ There is something horribly mysterious under all this , Athos ; this woman is one of the cardinal ’ s spies , I am sure of that. ” “ In that case , take care ! <EOS>	67.31970977783203
“ It is not your fault , my good Ali , ” said the count in the Arabic language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face— “ it is not your fault . <EOS>	75.01770782470703
But I do not mean , my friend that we were right in what we did . <EOS>	40.227142333984375
Oh , my lord ! ” continued the queen , without restraining her tears , “ it is better to fight as the king has done , and to die , as perhaps he will , than live in beggary like me. ” “ Courage , madame ! <EOS>	69.91949462890625

“ Really , Porthos , you are a gifted individual ! ” “ I have heard speak , ” said Porthos , “ of a certain Milo of Crotona , who performed wonderful feats , such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it—of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders , et cetera . <EOS>	327.0335998535156
It could no longer be doubted ; the family name was fully given . <EOS>	145.09910583496094

The stranger , whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom . <EOS>	127.03630065917969
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte . <EOS>	117.76971435546875
“ Undoubtedly , ” said Villefort , moderating the tones of his voice , “ a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which I was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground . <EOS>	193.18679809570312

But you , madame , so beautiful in reality , you , so pure in appearance , must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you thus. ” “ They have eyes , ” repeated Milady , with an accent of indescribable grief , “ but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not. ” “ But , ” cried the young officer , “ speak , then , speak ! ” “ Confide my shame to you , ” cried Milady , with the blush of modesty upon her countenance , “ for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another—confide my shame to you , a man , and I a woman ? <EOS>	83.01145935058594
Our duty is fulfilled. ” “ Not yet. ” said Aramis ; “ we have still a word to say to these gentlemen. ” And turning to Chatillon : “ Sir , be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I can not say before the queen. ” Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out , stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor . <EOS>	59.62578201293945
