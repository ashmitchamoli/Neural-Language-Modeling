First she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her , then Morrel stretched his arms towards her ; sometimes mere strangers , like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her ; even the very furniture , in these moments of delirium , seemed to move , and this state lasted till about three o ’ clock in the morning , when a deep , heavy slumber overcame the young girl , from which she did not awake till daylight . <EOS>	92.74884796142578

A few moments passed ; a great noise was heard at the gate . <EOS>	24.97598648071289
The fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds ; but at length D ’ Artagnan dropped his sword , which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick . <EOS>	43.74198532104492

At last he heard the voice of La Ramee . <EOS>	28.525144577026367

He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable , where he saw a little straw , but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body , which uttered a cry and arose on its knees , rubbing its eyes . <EOS>	73.78954315185547

The count is an affable man ; besides , he is unarmed ; at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance. ” “ Two soldiers , ” said D ’ Artagnan , seeming to remember something , “ two soldiers , yes ; that , then , is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour , under my window. ” “ That is it ; they are waiting for the cardinal , or rather for Bernouin , who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out. ” “ Fine-looking men , upon my word ! ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	61.741939544677734

The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment , and to be branded . <EOS>	50.269737243652344
“ And grandpapa has become my physician , and I have the greatest confidence in him , because he knows everything. ” “ Do you then really suffer ? ” asked Morrel quickly . <EOS>	41.91342544555664
“ It is I who cherish no resentment. ” Porthos didn ’ t understand any too clearly ; but then we know that understanding was not his strong point . <EOS>	81.16184997558594
“ Sire , ” replied Tréville , without lowering his voice in the least , “ either order my Musketeer to be restored to me , or let him be tried. ” “ He shall be tried , ” said the cardinal . <EOS>	36.77580261230469
M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars , on his left Morrel . <EOS>	31.403974533081055
There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening , but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burgundy . <EOS>	101.75263977050781
They were both aroused at seven o ’ clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant , who brought a letter for D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	34.008056640625
“ Gentlemen , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ you shall have your turn . <EOS>	7.345427513122559
Nevertheless , one thing afforded him inward consolation ; it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one . <EOS>	160.32557678222656
It would be impossible to describe Mousqueton ’ s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching , followed by a sergeant with a dozen men . <EOS>	51.55110168457031
He will not return till after the taking of the city. ” “ Ah , you fancy so ! <EOS>	60.084346771240234
But all the Italians are the same ; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in Oriental splendor. ” “ The young man is better , ” said Danglars . <EOS>	43.69302749633789
London . <EOS>	126.97235107421875
“ Ah , if you laugh , if you doubt me , ” replied Aramis , “ you shall know nothing. ” “ We believe like Mohammedans , and are as mute as tombstones , ” said Athos . <EOS>	29.694805145263672
As they returned toward the castle , D ’ Artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature , always dissatisfied with what it has , ever desirous of what it has not . <EOS>	83.78860473632812
“ Gentlemen , ” he said , “ you will admit that , when arrived at a certain degree of fortune , the superfluities of life are all that can be desired ; and the ladies will allow that , after having risen to a certain eminence of position , the ideal alone can be more exalted . <EOS>	78.41903686523438
The house , with kitchens and cellars below , had above the ground floor , two stories and attics . <EOS>	137.61349487304688
“ Gendarmes , ” said the president , “ lead in the accused. ” At these words the public attention became more intense , and all eyes were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter . <EOS>	40.98917007446289
“ Come , Laporte , ” said the queen . <EOS>	7.0875372886657715
One night Edmond awoke suddenly , believing that he heard someone calling him . <EOS>	163.54307556152344
As to the servant , she had run away at the moment of her master ’ s arrest . <EOS>	26.243576049804688
_Vanitas vanitatum ! _ According to your idea , then , my brain is turned . <EOS>	297.634033203125
“ How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left ? ” “ He is not a prince ; simply a count. ” “ A count , and a rich one too , eh ? ” “ Yes ; but you had better not have anything to say to him , for he is not a very good-tempered gentleman. ” “ Oh , be easy ! <EOS>	43.681644439697266
“ Monsieur , ” said the cardinal , “ are you a D ’ Artagnan from Béarn ? ” “ Yes , monseigneur , ” replied the young man . <EOS>	10.261882781982422
“ Why didn ’ t the baron come himself ? ” demanded Buckingham . <EOS>	33.17799377441406
“ Your profession ? ” “ First I was a forger , ” answered Andrea , as calmly as possible ; “ then I became a thief , and lately have become an assassin. ” A murmur , or rather storm , of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly . <EOS>	77.46061706542969
He soon felt that his ideas became again collected—he could think , and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning . <EOS>	161.8960723876953
Unfortunates , who ought to begin with God , do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance . <EOS>	160.26229858398438
“ Yes ; see , I send a ball into the moat ; a man is there who picks it up ; the ball contains a letter . <EOS>	79.86256408691406
I will warn them. ” “ What the devil are you going to do ? ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ you will be shot. ” But Athos heeded not his advice . <EOS>	25.699098587036133
He then called for his horses , drove to the Chamber , and inscribed his name to speak against the budget . <EOS>	69.88186645507812
The footman was withdrawing , but Athos stopped him by a sign . <EOS>	73.0217056274414
The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father ’ s death . <EOS>	67.17829895019531
“ At last we are off ! ” exclaimed Porthos . <EOS>	22.275236129760742
He then motioned to his wife to take leave . <EOS>	58.35221481323242
20061m “ Saved , my child ! ” said Morrel ; “ what do you mean ? ” “ Yes , saved—saved ! <EOS>	26.9954833984375
Grimaud made the sign yes . <EOS>	81.16413116455078
Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving ; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way , and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird . <EOS>	267.5055847167969
Tell me , I entreat you , my dear doctor , that you may be deceived. ” “ Doubtless I may , but—— ” “ But ? ” 30345m “ But I do not think so. ” “ Have pity on me doctor ! <EOS>	38.6595573425293
He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky , across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear ; before him was the vast expanse of waters , sombre and terrible , whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm . <EOS>	283.4172668457031
Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him , and remembering the recommendation of Athos , he , with the rapidity of lightning , made his horse rear as the shot was fired . <EOS>	88.73342895507812
But unfortunately I must wait. ” 40138m “ You must wait for what ? ” asked Caderousse . <EOS>	51.67146682739258
I told you Villefort was ambitious , and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything , even his father. ” “ Then , sire , may I present him ? ” “ This instant , duke ! <EOS>	91.05208587646484
But , no ; on reflection , the procureur was not a merciless man ; and it was not the magistrate , slave to his duties , but the friend , the loyal friend , who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption ; it was not the executioner , but the surgeon , who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son-in-law . <EOS>	82.58128356933594
It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen ; they had been ushered into Madame de Villefort ’ s room , who had said she would receive them there . <EOS>	33.38652038574219
“ I disturb you , perhaps , my dear Aramis , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , “ for by what I see , I am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen. ” Aramis colored imperceptibly . <EOS>	27.526470184326172
I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes , till I knew them nearly by heart ; so that since I have been in prison , a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me . <EOS>	160.2917938232422
“ Now , madame , ” continued Debray , first opening the closet , then the chest ; — “ now , madame , here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each , resembling , as you see , a large book bound in iron ; to this I add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs ; then , for the odd cash , making I think about 110,000 francs , here is a check upon my banker , who , not being M. Danglars , will pay you the amount , you may rest assured. ” Madame Danglars mechanically took the check , the bond , and the heap of bank-notes . <EOS>	110.84165954589844
No one answered . <EOS>	56.07614517211914
This concerns your head , I warn you. ” “ Who are you , then ? ” demanded D ’ Artagnan , lowering the point of his sword , but without yet surrendering it . <EOS>	28.45283317565918
Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance ; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other . <EOS>	102.52130889892578
Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance . <EOS>	155.73707580566406
“ What means this ? ” asked the count . <EOS>	11.448362350463867
Besides , one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused , in order to lash one ’ s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power . <EOS>	92.8438491821289
Dantès was then guilty , and now he is innocent , and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him. ” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry , which , however improbable it might be , if it did take place would leave him defenceless . <EOS>	106.8544692993164
What he ? ” asked the cardinal . <EOS>	21.482421875
Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore , and , instead of landing at the usual place , he dropped anchor in the little creek . <EOS>	88.43778991699219
With the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month . <EOS>	44.884559631347656
Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac , a favorite of the cardinal ’ s . <EOS>	58.55183410644531
colonel , pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow. ” “ Yes , ” said Harrison , laughing , and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table . <EOS>	78.99336242675781
I am about , perhaps , to discover something here ; I am in the vein. ” She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor . <EOS>	48.02396011352539
30297m At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms , after giving her orders , many guests were arriving , more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count ; for , owing to the good taste of Mercédès , one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing , or even copying in case of need . <EOS>	173.5772705078125
But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn . <EOS>	324.0394287109375
The general was stout and tall , the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down . <EOS>	73.42630767822266
Danglars then opened the window . <EOS>	33.8071174621582
Of course it is of no consequence , ” he added , with a withering smile . <EOS>	31.252744674682617
The fowl pecked at the rabbit , and the next day was a dead hen . <EOS>	73.47369384765625
For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind , and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him . <EOS>	147.2435302734375
The king , excited by the cardinal , made a terrible clamor . <EOS>	41.40482711791992
D ’ Artagnan , who had fixed on his color beforehand , had only to select the shade , and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer . <EOS>	89.34749603271484
I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner , a friend of the Duc de Beaufort , who called for help . <EOS>	27.343584060668945
Already Dantès had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times , and seeing all these hardy free-traders , who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent , he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds . <EOS>	273.7586669921875
Yes , as you said , you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you . <EOS>	94.7452621459961
D ’ Artagnan ! <EOS>	9.270452499389648
34 . <EOS>	53.40269088745117
Tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator , and muscular as a Spartan , he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps , actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken . <EOS>	132.34860229492188
“ Interested man ! ” cried she , smiling . <EOS>	19.53812599182129
“ Charlotte Backson , Comtesse de la Fère , Milady de Winter , ” said he , “ your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven . <EOS>	72.52381896972656
He believed , having triumphed over me in my sleep , that all was completed . <EOS>	108.28207397460938
“ Let us go , then , ” said Athos . <EOS>	5.505263805389404
Keep the purse for your lackeys. ” D ’ Artagnan put the purse into his pocket . <EOS>	48.346351623535156
He was the same man , or rather the development of the same man , whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at Marseilles . <EOS>	93.2166519165039
I too , sir , was almost dead when you arrived. ” “ Wait , wait , young man ; do not fatigue yourself with speaking . <EOS>	72.86490631103516
I am from the country. ” “ Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets . <EOS>	172.50872802734375
Rest assured , we shall not see her. ” “ And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal ? ” “ Immediately . <EOS>	25.99169921875
‘ The first will be _mazzolato_ , the second _decapitato_. ’ Yes , ” continued the count , “ it was at first arranged in this way ; but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony. ” “ Really ? ” said Franz . <EOS>	47.58551025390625
Bazin ! <EOS>	103.15221405029297
Ali , is the supper ready ? ” At this moment the tapestry moved aside , and a Nubian , black as ebony , and dressed in a plain white tunic , made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room . <EOS>	83.14944458007812
Why , the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for each other. ” “ My Lord , ” cried the queen , “ you forget that I have never said that I love you. ” “ But you have never told me that you did not love me ; and truly , to speak such words to me would be , on the part of your Majesty , too great an ingratitude . <EOS>	38.61386489868164
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width , darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees , and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts . <EOS>	174.86309814453125
ah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ there are two of them , then ! ” “ I wish there were four , ” said Athos ; “ the two parties would then be equal. ” “ Perhaps there are four , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	16.74566650390625
Chapter XI . <EOS>	18.581050872802734
The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property ? <EOS>	105.36561584472656
He clung to one idea—that of his happiness , destroyed , without apparent cause , by an unheard-of fatality ; he considered and reconsidered this idea , devoured it ( so to speak ) , as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante . <EOS>	226.9118194580078
And what brought you here ? ” “ I came to thank God for my happy deliverance , ” said Rochefort . <EOS>	40.836971282958984
I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged. ” Villefort cast a gloomy look around him . <EOS>	80.91368865966797
“ Do you think he died a natural death ? ” A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirtier . <EOS>	61.76411056518555
The Beggar The evening passed on ; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris , which Madame Danglars had not dared to do , notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced . <EOS>	51.13478088378906
While thinking and walking , Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove , broken in halves , the other extremity passing into the chamber above ; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words , which at length fixed his attention . <EOS>	125.5737075805664
Porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator ’ s wife in the cloister of St. Magloire . <EOS>	50.906375885009766
“ Planchet , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I am going out for all day , perhaps . <EOS>	9.815286636352539
“ You sent for me ? ” he said to the prisoner . <EOS>	13.73277473449707
Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . <EOS>	79.50096130371094
They carried him through an alley , up a flight of stairs , and deposited him in an antechamber . <EOS>	73.89183044433594
“ Well , ” he asked , “ that will do , will it not ? ” “ Yes , my lord , on one condition. ” “ What ? ” “ That Grimaud shall wait on us at table. ” Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke , however , he had presence of mind enough to exclaim : “ To the devil with your Grimaud ! <EOS>	41.97047424316406
Oh , I repeat it , Edmond ; what you have just done is beautiful—it is grand ; it is sublime. ” “ Do you say so now , Mercédès ? —then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you ? <EOS>	64.95124816894531
Bonacieux away , and convey her to a place of safety , and there , if matters required , make her a hostage . <EOS>	109.93106079101562
D ’ Artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years ’ standing . <EOS>	36.20920181274414
God will punish you ! <EOS>	85.51435089111328
Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle-field . <EOS>	205.05865478515625
We will grow old together and talk of our companions. ” “ No ! ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ deuce take it , the campaign is going to begin ; I wish to be there , I expect to get something by it. ” “ What do you expect to get ? ” “ Why , I expect to be made Marechal of France ! ” “ Ha ! <EOS>	43.79213333129883
She was a most atrocious woman. ” “ And then , ” said Aramis , with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God , “ what is the use of thinking of it all ? <EOS>	59.75759506225586
What has happened ? ” asked the countess , as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life ; “ did you say a misfortune ? <EOS>	44.191566467285156
Chapter VIII . <EOS>	13.527271270751953
The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous . <EOS>	239.6377410888672
The bills were renewed , the old ones destroyed , and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources . <EOS>	112.09075164794922
“ Yes , ” indicated the old man . <EOS>	13.981807708740234
Mademoiselle d ’ Armilly , whom they then perceived through the open doorway , formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so fond . <EOS>	103.51416778564453
It is easy to suppose that Morrel ’ s agitation would not escape the count ’ s penetrating eye . <EOS>	38.28948974609375
Do you remember , sir , that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des Carmes ? <EOS>	82.3917007446289
He raised him , almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture , at the risk of flaying him in the passage . <EOS>	69.1952896118164
“ No false generosity , count ! <EOS>	145.80154418945312
“ Yes ; but your father died in your arms , happy , respected , rich , and full of years ; his father died poor , despairing , almost doubtful of Providence ; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards , his tomb had disappeared , and no one could say , ‘ There sleeps the father you so well loved. ’ ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed Morrel . <EOS>	99.17729187011719
“ A letter ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	6.9877753257751465
“ Pardon me , ” said Albert , “ I was not aware that he was a prince . <EOS>	10.990230560302734
“ The affair at Armentieres , ” whispered D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	14.52384090423584
D ’ Avrigny , unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion , turned away ; and Villefort , without seeking any further explanation , and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn , extended his hand towards the young man . <EOS>	101.0694580078125
But what if I were mistaken ? ” A shudder passed over him . <EOS>	46.07834243774414
“ I think I understand his reason , ” said Morrel . <EOS>	17.146764755249023
I forgot , ” said Athos , laughing . <EOS>	14.252398490905762
But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready , and they were arising from table , the stranger proposed to Porthos to drink the health of the cardinal . <EOS>	55.66664123535156
The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door ; no one ventured to speak , for fear of disturbing him . <EOS>	51.118778228759766
It was just two o ’ clock by Albert ’ s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing-room . <EOS>	32.4581298828125
The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo ; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife . <EOS>	124.17146301269531
“ How , sir ! ” said Planchet , “ is it you ? ” “ Eh ! <EOS>	11.54734992980957
“ Faith , I ’ ve half a mind to do it . <EOS>	50.542442321777344
But I was unable to accept your invitation , having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of Château-Renaud. ” This was followed by rather an awkward silence . <EOS>	134.76531982421875
Dantès folded his hands , raised his eyes to heaven , and prayed fervently . <EOS>	40.04606246948242
Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves ; the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea . <EOS>	125.3397445678711
M. Danglars no longer had a daughter . <EOS>	53.070770263671875
Quiet was at length restored . <EOS>	859.089599609375
Pale , and sweetly smiling , she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance . <EOS>	233.51930236816406
Is he still as stingy as ever ? <EOS>	152.2607879638672
At last , one day , when for the hundredth time I took up my spade , I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child . <EOS>	53.85531997680664

It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy , they would like him all the better for it ; but that Athos , on the contrary , would despise him . <EOS>	46.8548583984375
We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared . <EOS>	140.13670349121094
We must be expeditious . <EOS>	64.37530517578125
I told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those , in houses that had no signs ; but she always laughed at me . <EOS>	185.44976806640625
He was carried home in the arms of the people . <EOS>	39.61287307739258

Bonacieux , without any suspicion , accompanied her . <EOS>	66.31742858886719
During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office , and wrapped the corpse in the winding-sheet , which , whatever may be said about the equality of death , is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life . <EOS>	93.91255950927734
Those who are known are not the most dangerous. ” “ I know it , and appeal to your penetration . <EOS>	57.860496520996094
“ Did you not yet know me ? <EOS>	23.048686981201172
And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing . <EOS>	166.8923797607422
“ Let D ’ Artagnan speak , ” said Athos ; “ you know he always has wise advice to give. ” “ Clearly , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ we must go where they will not look for us . <EOS>	23.703506469726562
Then , wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor , he continued to work without ceasing . <EOS>	67.70983123779297
“ Halloo ! <EOS>	33.51076889038086
On his right hand and his left were two footmen , with the seams of their dresses laced . <EOS>	116.25582122802734
I prize it—it was given to my ancestor by King Francis I . <EOS>	280.9705505371094
He immediately signalled it . <EOS>	141.0514678955078
“ Fourteen years ! ” he muttered . <EOS>	27.227224349975586
let ’ s be merciful to every sinner ! <EOS>	307.95416259765625
If I were not in such haste , and if I were not running after someone , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	20.00218963623047
The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise , where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family . <EOS>	49.5245246887207
“ At the first swallow , it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning . <EOS>	38.02802276611328
The praise was well deserved , for had not the count heard it from the baroness , or by one of those means by which he knew everything , the baron ’ s countenance would not have led him to suspect it . <EOS>	61.16172409057617
“ Stop , let me show you the way. ” “ It is not worthwhile. ” “ Yes , it is. ” “ Why ? ” “ Because there is a little secret , a precaution I thought it desirable to take , one of Huret & Fichet ’ s locks , revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse ; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist. ” “ Thank you , ” said Andrea ; “ I will let you know a week beforehand. ” They parted . <EOS>	46.11835861206055
Brave , rash , and enterprising , this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts . <EOS>	76.6023178100586
Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half-past six . <EOS>	225.78814697265625
But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword , I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it. ” Bazin , scandalized , made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand . <EOS>	124.66173553466797
D ’ Artagnan , who , as we have said , was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty , then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady . <EOS>	62.56829071044922
They accepted his offer ; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left , Albert started for Naples . <EOS>	112.05516052246094
You are rich then , my dear Monsieur Bonacieux ? ” “ I am comfortably off , monsieur , that ’ s all ; I have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business , but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet ; so that you understand , monsieur—But ! — ” cried the citizen . <EOS>	86.73509979248047
I make a match ? <EOS>	66.66381072998047
There was no answer , and she continued : “ I have not seen you all day . <EOS>	28.037965774536133
You are not joking , are you ? ” “ No , on the honor of an officer ; there is the half-pistole ; ” and he showed him the seductive coin , but did not give it him . <EOS>	37.01601028442383
“ Since you appear to know so many things , can you tell me what is become of that woman ? ” “ I presume that she has returned to Tours. ” “ To Tours ? <EOS>	26.57847785949707
Then , turning towards Albert , — “ It is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek , both of which Haydée speaks so fluently ; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian , which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation. ” The count made a sign to Haydée to address his visitor . <EOS>	71.43376922607422
D ’ Artagnan had not failed in his career , but circumstances had been adverse to him . <EOS>	34.16558074951172
The Guards of the cardinal , perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps , invited him to retire before they attacked. ” “ So you may plainly see , Tréville , ” interrupted the king , “ it was they who attacked ? ” “ That is true , sire ; there can be no more doubt on that head . <EOS>	45.36333465576172
Her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea ; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly : “ Edmond , Edmond , Edmond ! ” Chapter 113 . <EOS>	82.25337219238281
coward ! <EOS>	117.23680877685547
The room was inundated with blood , dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man , speechless ; the monk had disappeared . <EOS>	82.8145751953125
Porthos placed his hand on the pistols . <EOS>	24.421836853027344
sir ! <EOS>	50.508182525634766
But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed , and that all his faculties were completely destroyed ? ” “ Yes , his bodily faculties , for he can neither move nor speak , nevertheless he thinks , acts , and wills in the manner I have described . <EOS>	104.83024597167969
Cloud , in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d ’ Estrées.—C.B. ” While reading this letter , D ’ Artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers . <EOS>	113.83036041259766
That woman had , in all probability , poisoned my brother , and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn . <EOS>	47.13028335571289
“ Are you satisfied , my lord ? ” he asked . <EOS>	7.483686923980713
“ Take out the horses quickly , and come up to me , ” said Andrea to his groom . <EOS>	36.592079162597656
The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous ; Teresa gave him one—only , instead of Teresa , it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giacomo. ” “ What ! ” exclaimed Franz , “ the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_ from him—— ” “ Was a lad of fifteen , ” replied Peppino . <EOS>	65.77013397216797
“ Fear nothing , ” he said ; “ I have my conditions to impose . <EOS>	27.293373107910156
“ What happened to the worthy captain ? ” “ He died. ” “ Fell into the sea ? ” “ No , sir , he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony. ” Then turning to the crew , he said , “ Bear a hand there , to take in sail ! ” All hands obeyed , and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew , sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul , topsail sheets and halyards , the jib downhaul , and the topsail clewlines and buntlines . <EOS>	104.23186492919922
What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M. Magendie or M. Flourens , in consequence of the rabbits , cats , and guinea-pigs they have killed ? —not one . <EOS>	165.4425506591797

“ Do with this commission what you will ; only remember , though the name be blank , it is to you I give it. ” “ I shall never forget it , ” replied D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	36.6711540222168
D ’ Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room , the three Musketeers and the two Guards following him . <EOS>	41.41230010986328
But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken . <EOS>	69.29886627197266
Mousqueton , at the head of them , wiped his eyes . <EOS>	33.64509963989258
But you are here , my dear fellow , let us speak of you . <EOS>	17.15827178955078
The fool ! <EOS>	110.762939453125
Has the law any eyes to witness your grief ? <EOS>	195.9925537109375
Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand , and twice had Villefort soothed him with promises . <EOS>	506.5234069824219
Why , this very morning , in my rooms , he made his _entrée_ amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement , not even excepting Château-Renaud. ” “ And what do you suppose is the count ’ s age ? ” inquired Mercédès , evidently attaching great importance to this question . <EOS>	86.33588409423828
“ Diavolo ! ” said the cardinal , pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration ; “ I should have cried , I should. ” At this moment the tumult was heard nearer . <EOS>	41.69761657714844
“ Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort , ” he said to the nurse . <EOS>	12.860806465148926
No , be assured , I am not mad . <EOS>	18.51111602783203
He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent , but Barrois , who had heard all that passed , had guessed his master ’ s wishes , and had already gone to fetch one . <EOS>	47.514564514160156
The halt at Noyon was but brief , every one there being wrapped in profound sleep . <EOS>	304.0433349609375
I will call on you , sir , since you bid me contemplate , for the advantage of my pride , this terrible spectacle , which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family. ” “ It would have been so unquestionably , had not God given me so large a compensation . <EOS>	62.71773147583008
“ Certainly , I excuse you , ” said Monte Cristo graciously , “ and pocket them. ” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book . <EOS>	34.03952407836914
It was this that made me start when you said the other day , at M. de Morcerf ’ s , that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers . <EOS>	63.67216873168945
We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin , and then—— ” “ The devil ! ” said Porthos ; “ what can we say to Mazarin ? ” “ Leave that to me—I have my plan . <EOS>	30.611675262451172
I will say—— ” “ Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself ? ” said Bertuccio , in so calm a tone , and with so steadfast a look , that Andrea was moved to the very soul . <EOS>	47.4720344543457
M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago ; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation. ” “ I am ready , my son , ” said Mercédès . <EOS>	30.237701416015625
Porthos , in spite of a touch of vanity , has many excellent qualities . <EOS>	57.53776931762695
The four old Friends prepare to meet again . <EOS>	72.5565414428711
His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled . <EOS>	211.13919067382812
You can see it in his eye . <EOS>	64.26630401611328
your honor ! ” cried Planchet , “ I ’ ve a man behind me. ” D ’ Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet ’ s horse . <EOS>	38.268890380859375
“ It is not here ! ” 50197m And then he moved farther on , and began again to dig . <EOS>	56.16059875488281
While the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto , Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband ’ s strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at Milan . <EOS>	68.02188873291016
A hundred writers since Socrates , Seneca , St. Augustine , and Gall , have made , in verse and prose , the comparison you have made , and yet I can well understand that a father ’ s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son . <EOS>	133.99880981445312
If you do , I swear to you , for I have got to the end of my strength , that I will dash my brains out against the wall , and you will have my death to reproach yourself with. ” “ How old are you ? <EOS>	32.2188835144043
“ On , on ! ” he cried , “ this is no moment for compliments ; or rather , back , for the battle seems to be lost by the Frondeurs. ” “ It is a matter of indifference to me , ” said Aramis ; “ I came here only to meet De Chatillon ; I have met him , I am contented ; ’ tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel ! ” “ And besides , we have a prisoner , ” said Athos , pointing to Raoul . <EOS>	31.459548950195312
“ For myself , on the other hand , my lord , ” returned the governor , “ when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand , since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up , dead or alive. ” And once more he bowed low before his highness . <EOS>	60.56645202636719
D ’ Artagnan picked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter . <EOS>	22.2607421875
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to Albert . <EOS>	45.630523681640625
“ To the sheets , ” said he . <EOS>	10.829032897949219
Suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled , and the perspiration dried on his forehead . <EOS>	147.23468017578125
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions . <EOS>	87.39794921875
“ He ! <EOS>	41.34249496459961
Bonacieux ; “ somebody is coming. ” Immediately the door opened , and the superior entered . <EOS>	80.2674789428711
Alas , would I could weep like you ! ” And he drew away his friend , as affectionate as a father , as consoling as a priest , noble as a man who has suffered much . <EOS>	62.57685470581055
“ How ? <EOS>	22.642749786376953
But when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men , and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment , try to find your affectionate heart , which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber. ” “ But tell me , ” said Beauchamp , “ what is life ? <EOS>	50.77016067504883
don ’ t be a coward , or I shall cut off your ears . <EOS>	26.852399826049805
The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there , and the sheets , to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung , were dragged across the room . <EOS>	84.2215805053711
Only remember this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear ( for you will look and you will listen , I am quite sure , however we may threaten you ) , you are lost. ’ At these words he threw me a crown , which I picked up , and he took the ladder . <EOS>	87.47216796875
“ At what time you please , sir , ” replied Franz . <EOS>	12.639557838439941
“ However , to Teresa ’ s great astonishment , Luigi remained mute , and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening . <EOS>	97.56578063964844
As he approached , Carlini raised his head , and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man ’ s eyes . <EOS>	27.4207820892334
“ I will not sign this order ! <EOS>	55.78525924682617
A large round rock , placed solidly on its base , was the only spot to which they seemed to lead . <EOS>	80.74687957763672
“ Come , then , come , then ! ” cried Milady , trying to drag the young woman along by the arm . <EOS>	26.815536499023438
The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having , as he said , cleaned his drawing-paper for him ; he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarin ’ s life . <EOS>	106.88218688964844
D ’ Artagnan alone was calm , at least in appearance . <EOS>	33.327842712402344
While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina , which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli palaces , Franz ’ s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace , for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant . <EOS>	110.09672546386719
The daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed , had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer—a service in which , he said , his soul was in constant jeopardy . <EOS>	75.4483413696289
“ It is not here ! ” he cried . <EOS>	8.975167274475098
This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne . <EOS>	137.38807678222656
“ Pray , Signor Pastrini , ” asked Franz , “ is not some execution appointed to take place today ? ” “ Yes , your excellency ; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from , you are much too late. ” “ Oh , no , ” answered Franz , “ I had no such intention ; and even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle , I might have done so from Monte Pincio ; could I not ? ” “ Ah ! ” exclaimed mine host , “ I did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill , which , indeed , they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves. ” “ Very possibly I may not go , ” answered Franz ; “ but in case I feel disposed , give me some particulars of today ’ s executions. ” “ What particulars would your excellency like to hear ? ” “ Why , the number of persons condemned to suffer , their names , and description of the death they are to die. ” “ That happens just lucky , your excellency ! <EOS>	69.83988952636719
I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs , and he appears likely to succeed . <EOS>	97.15593719482422
You asked me the cause of my being late , and why I come disguised . <EOS>	94.01341247558594
You see I am a good sort of a man. ” “ Do not jest about holy things , my friend. ” “ Go on , then , I listen. ” “ I had been at the seminary from nine years old ; in three days I should have been twenty . <EOS>	36.85898971557617
This example was imitated by the rest , until the room filled silently , as if these men had been the humblest , most devoted courtiers . <EOS>	118.78884887695312
I will answer for it , her resentment will not hold out against such an attention. ” “ Monsieur Cardinal , you know that I do not like worldly pleasures. ” “ The queen will only be the more grateful to you , as she knows your antipathy for that amusement ; besides , it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself. ” “ We shall see , Monsieur Cardinal , we shall see , ” said the king , who , in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about , and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread , was ready to make up all differences with her , “ we shall see , but upon my honor , you are too indulgent toward her. ” “ Sire , ” said the cardinal , “ leave severity to your ministers . <EOS>	69.02945709228516
Toward four o ’ clock in the morning the doctor arrived ; but since the time Milady stabbed herself , however short , the wound had closed . <EOS>	76.67884063720703
The king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête . <EOS>	87.16476440429688
It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening . <EOS>	72.10562133789062
Twice he was obliged to step back ; his opponent stirred not one inch . <EOS>	269.2010498046875
Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that had been named to him , delivered his letter to the captain , who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail . <EOS>	128.09622192382812
In the evening M. de Tréville attended the king ’ s gaming table . <EOS>	53.90034103393555
“ Am I—am I , then , to sleep on the floor ? ” asked Gaston d ’ Orleans , with a forced smile . <EOS>	48.192359924316406

“ And then , ” continued Mme . <EOS>	8.604945182800293
The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie , which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected . <EOS>	57.4603157043457
As he alighted , he thought he saw his father ’ s pale face behind the curtain of the count ’ s bedroom . <EOS>	22.968917846679688
Albert kissed his mother ’ s hand , and drew near the count . <EOS>	20.916105270385742
He recovered a little , reopened his eyes , and hope revived in all hearts . <EOS>	155.2649688720703
She must have a long arm. ” “ Hush ! ” said Porthos , placing a finger on his lips . <EOS>	23.810131072998047
It was Mousqueton , who , having no straw to lie upon , had helped himself to that of the horses . <EOS>	69.41597747802734
Her face was so passionless , that he , as every one else present , was incapable of reading her thoughts . <EOS>	90.184814453125
I come to say that today , and for the remainder of the Carnival , I leave the carriage entirely at your disposal . <EOS>	53.38736343383789
There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe . <EOS>	145.8191375732422
Woe to them if it be so ! ” And he turned around , so stern with anger , strength and threat , that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another , in order to escape , and some of them even rolled into the Seine . <EOS>	92.85474395751953
At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened , and a woman appeared . <EOS>	31.20363426208496
why to me ? ” “ Why , you killed him ! <EOS>	34.48888397216797
D ’ Artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke , who , having accompanied him in all his voyages , spoke French perfectly well ; he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death , and that he must speak with his master instantly . <EOS>	59.1340446472168
Thirty strides brought them to dry land ; the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet , and looked around for someone to show him his road , for it was quite dark . <EOS>	104.75274658203125
The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Eminence . <EOS>	97.56745910644531
the queen has not only one son , but two ; then , Monsieur de Coligny was killed , and—— ” “ Yes , ” said Mazarin , “ but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal ! ” “ No , my lord , but he will be , ” answered the guard . <EOS>	27.391019821166992
He was very successful upon that question . <EOS>	77.73201751708984
“ In Madame de Villefort ’ s room ? ” he murmured and slowly returned , with one hand wiping his forehead , and with the other supporting himself against the wall . <EOS>	31.214229583740234
“ On the contrary , I think they are poor , sir. ” “ They are friends of yours , then ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” exclaimed Mordaunt , “ they are friends , dear friends of mine , and I would lay down my life for them. ” “ Very well , Mordaunt , ” exclaimed Cromwell , pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more ; “ I will give them to you ; I will not even ask who they are ; do as you like with them. ” “ Thank you , sir ! ” exclaimed Mordaunt , “ thank you ; my life is always at your service , and should I lose it I should still owe you something ; thank you ; you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services. ” He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell , and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general , who did not like this almost kingly homage , he took his hand and kissed it . <EOS>	42.829002380371094

Eleven o ’ clock had struck . <EOS>	300.2125244140625

You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs , which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses , so that there is not much of a score between us ; —but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate , and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take. ” “ Upon my word , ” said Albert , “ I deserve no credit for what I could not help , namely , a determination to take everything as I found it , and to let those bandits see , that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world , there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself . <EOS>	99.08672332763672

No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes , for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness , and which ran as follows : “ ‘ Madame and most faithful wife. ’ ” Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness , whose face became covered with blushes . <EOS>	65.73589324951172

The salutation was so well understood that Morrel , with the same expression in his eyes , placed his handkerchief to his mouth ; and these two living statues , whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect , separated from each other by the whole length of the room , forgot themselves for a moment , or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation . <EOS>	76.24559020996094

Three of my best soldiers , whom your Majesty knows by name , and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated , and who have , I dare affirm to the king , his service much at heart—three of my best soldiers , I say , Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from Gascony , whom I had introduced to them the same morning . <EOS>	88.87596130371094

I will then release you from all your promises—even that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers ; for before everything , I wish to avenge myself. ” “ Beware , young man ! ” cried Tréville . <EOS>	66.88886260986328

During the whole time he was speaking , the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor ’ s harangue ; but terminating as it did with such a phrase , the only one which could be caught at by the jokers , Anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites , which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies . <EOS>	80.79278564453125
These leaders had corn in abundance , and would not let them partake of it ; they adopted as a maxim—for they , too , had maxims—that it was of very little consequence that women , children , and old men should die , so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy . <EOS>	134.78016662597656

He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was , and that he would be obedient to her orders . <EOS>	40.93074035644531
His wife , on the contrary , whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle , was pale , meagre , and sickly-looking . <EOS>	91.85136413574219
But D ’ Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried , “ Wait ! ” Athos stopped . <EOS>	38.85067367553711
Surely , if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon , I ought to be forgiven. ” Then , as if his strength failed him , he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head , which drowned his voice . <EOS>	64.39353942871094
Shall you keep it or send it back ? ” “ I shall keep it , Aramis , and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it . <EOS>	58.414798736572266

It was true , and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning ; he gave his horse its head , struck his spurs into its sides , and the animal , urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him , bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place , and fell into the river , scattering to a distance waves of white froth . <EOS>	105.13700866699219
“ When I see her majesty embarrassed , I shall conduct her to Rueil , make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box. ” “ Enough , sir , ” muttered the cardinal , “ you have said enough ; where is the treaty ? ” “ Here it is , ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	45.4336051940918
“ Adieu ; or rather , _au revoir_. ” The mendicant continued to rip his garments ; and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles , which he laid down on the table ; then he opened the door , bowed , and went out before the young man , stupefied by his letter , had ventured to address a word to him . <EOS>	62.70203399658203
But what can I do with you ? <EOS>	17.23223114013672

“ Help , help ! ” Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps , then fell at the feet of Noirtier , and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid , exclaimed : “ My master , my good master ! ” At this moment M. de Villefort , attracted by the noise , appeared on the threshold . <EOS>	35.07294464111328
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques . <EOS>	29.345247268676758

Our position is truly a strange one , ” continued Athos , laughing . <EOS>	54.159912109375
“ I think so ; am I not right , M. de Villefort ? ” asked Monte Cristo . <EOS>	13.693635940551758
Their spirits live in me . <EOS>	410.1763916015625
I do not understand you. ” “ So much the better , I have a ray of hope left ; listen. ” “ I am all attention , ” said Eugénie , looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze . <EOS>	51.26823425292969
“ Are you asleep , that you don ’ t answer when I ring ? ” And D ’ Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently . <EOS>	29.490825653076172
As to the Bastile , they are not there , though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs . <EOS>	57.75657653808594

For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor alone. ” Athos smiled . <EOS>	153.3856964111328
Although you say I do not like him , I assure you I shall be happy to see him. ” “ I will obey your orders , my lord. ” “ Good-bye. ” “ Until Saturday , when I may expect you , may I not ? ” “ Yes , I promised you. ” The Count watched Albert , waving his hand to him . <EOS>	35.354026794433594

Tomorrow , by twelve o ’ clock , I shall have the order for your exile , signed , _Buckingham_ . <EOS>	56.93116760253906
Moreover , great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd ; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused , so to speak , of coming insurrection , as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum . <EOS>	420.49810791015625

She raised her head with an effort . <EOS>	44.76068115234375
But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aramis . <EOS>	135.87255859375
Next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact , with the names of the victim and the murderer . <EOS>	156.4148406982422
Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host , who rushed into the apartment crying out , “ The Spaniards ! <EOS>	106.9403076171875
“ And besides , ” he said , “ going out of this chamber isn ’ t all. ” “ Dear friend , ” said Porthos , “ you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to-day than you were yesterday . <EOS>	34.945556640625

“ Come in , my dear John , ” said Lord de Winter , “ come in , and shut the door. ” The young officer entered . <EOS>	17.123291015625
Milady will then turn you out of doors , and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance. ” “ Alas ! ” said Kitty , “ for whom have I exposed myself to all that ? ” “ For me , I well know , my sweet girl , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	38.34003448486328
“ Obey , ” said Noirtier ’ s intelligent eye . <EOS>	42.30024719238281
He will never see you again ; all is over . <EOS>	54.57551956176758
Broussel ’ s son was there , still furious , and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king ’ s officers . <EOS>	92.9592514038086
The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead ; the rest of the troop took to flight . <EOS>	105.01646423339844
He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals , and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell . <EOS>	76.88482666015625
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace ; but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet , trembling all over , locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers . <EOS>	106.15662384033203
He is a young , ingenuous , pure man who seems virtuous ; him there are means of destroying. ” And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips . <EOS>	85.77743530273438
Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini , and asked for Albert de Morcerf . <EOS>	37.78990173339844
“ What is the meaning of that noise ? ” “ Oh , my God ! ” cried Morrel , turning pale , “ what is it ? ” A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily , and half-stifled sobs . <EOS>	26.6533260345459
I concluded that , by some singular chance , the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself ; but , as I entered my apartments , I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider . <EOS>	139.11756896972656
Your captivity shall be mild , be assured ; and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification , here is , in addition to the price of the studs , an order for a thousand pistoles , to make you forget the annoyance I cause you. ” D ’ Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister , who thus open-handed , sported with men and millions . <EOS>	106.68477630615234
Shall I speak to him ? <EOS>	45.50352478027344
On perceiving Monte Cristo , she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself , expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love . <EOS>	66.4186019897461
“ Yes , that is the very boy ; he ’ s patronized by Bazin. ” “ Ah , yes , I know. ” “ Of what importance is this little reptile to you ? ” asked Porthos . <EOS>	28.689409255981445
“ What an injustice , my dear invalid ! <EOS>	49.89479064941406
“ Let us see , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	4.462185859680176
“ Well , ” said Porthos , “ what do you want , and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation ? ” “ Hush ! ” said Athos , speaking in a low voice . <EOS>	9.935891151428223
It became necessary , therefore , to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism—a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling . <EOS>	343.78857421875
I went out as if to fetch wood , passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar , and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door , pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me . <EOS>	111.61084747314453
Turning towards Athos and his friends , “ Gentlemen , ” said he , “ allow me to correct your words , if you please . <EOS>	28.27121353149414
Is it from mere humanity you bid me live ? <EOS>	431.5396728515625
Charles , having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos , embraced them both . <EOS>	119.45428466796875
“ Who comes there ? ” cried the sentinel , who was less abstracted , and who saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief . <EOS>	61.81228256225586
“ In the first place , ” said Athos , “ let us leave this chamber ; the dead are not agreeable company , particularly when they have died a violent death. ” “ Planchet , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care . <EOS>	29.490333557128906
‘ Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said ? ’ Another sign in the negative . <EOS>	90.3028564453125

What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean with a fine wench of seventeen ? ” “ And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans ? ” “ He went before I came down. ” “ Let us go the same way ; we will stop at La Réserve , and we can drink a glass of La Malgue , whilst we wait for news. ” “ Come along , ” said Caderousse ; “ but you pay the score. ” “ Of course , ” replied Danglars ; and going quickly to the designated place , they called for a bottle of wine , and two glasses . <EOS>	60.03285598754883
“ You see , ” said Raoul , “ we have done wisely. ” “ What a horrible face that monk has , ” said De Guiche . <EOS>	27.925952911376953
Aramis , after a journey into Lorraine , disappeared all at once , and ceased to write to his friends ; they learned at a later period through Mme . <EOS>	71.57502746582031
The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her affection , and he also , like Morrel , followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover . <EOS>	122.71066284179688
We are observed ; they are coming to meet us . <EOS>	39.71812057495117
She was in tears , and , strange as it was , in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears , he looked also at Madame de Villefort , and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips , like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky . <EOS>	71.94084167480469
The arrest produced no sensation , indeed was almost unknown , and scarcely interrupted the course of events . <EOS>	164.6589813232422
Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars , and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes . <EOS>	101.85118103027344
“ What was it that you thought ? ” asked the young man anxiously , in his turn descending from the table . <EOS>	22.258264541625977
and you are not afraid of that , Athos ? ” “ No , ” replied Athos , “ it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear. ” “ Now , ” said Aramis , “ tell me a little what you do fear. ” “ Nothing for the present ; at least , nothing in good earnest. ” “ And with regard to the past ? ” asked Porthos . <EOS>	20.40876007080078
Your fellow-countryman , Bonaparte , became emperor. ” We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican . <EOS>	165.2196044921875

Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown , whom he loved already ; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening , he would kill him with his water jug . <EOS>	165.16004943847656
A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour . <EOS>	88.01486206054688
It was not their proximity that alarmed us , for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhône , but the care , according to the boy ’ s account , that they took to avoid being seen . <EOS>	121.40642547607422
Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear . <EOS>	265.3710632324219

They must disappear , broken , scattered , annihilated . <EOS>	214.74668884277344
“ My first impressions were favorable to the minister ; I said to myself that a minister is never loved , but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared , which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved—— ” D ’ Artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim . <EOS>	83.49825286865234
His natural prudence , however , never forsook him for a single instant . <EOS>	78.70002746582031
You will forgive me , sir , for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine . <EOS>	53.588294982910156

“ But , while we are speaking of business , ” Danglars added , pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject , “ tell me what I am to do for M.

This gentleman was a young man , scarcely sixteen years of age , now white with anger . <EOS>	47.5683708190918
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step . <EOS>	185.71011352539062
But there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé ; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of Armida . <EOS>	105.7115478515625

Two methods of self-destruction were at his disposal . <EOS>	166.07083129882812
But at the first word the young woman started , and exclaimed in a sharp , bantering tone , which sounded strangely in the darkness , “ Are you afraid , dear Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ? ” “ You can not think so , dear love ! ” replied D ’ Artagnan ; “ but now , suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him ? ” “ At all events , ” said Milady , seriously , “ he has deceived me , and from the moment he deceived me , he merited death. ” “ He shall die , then , since you condemn him ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion . <EOS>	42.335872650146484

Besides , let me own something to you . <EOS>	70.33882904052734
“ Excuse me , gentlemen , ” said Morrel , “ but I do not see M. de Morcerf. ” “ He sent us word this morning , ” replied Château-Renaud , “ that he would meet us on the ground. ” “ Ah , ” said Morrel . <EOS>	14.882556915283203

Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought . <EOS>	71.46610260009766
It is the count ’ s reply. ” Poor Kitty became as pale as death ; she suspected what the letter contained . <EOS>	68.14710998535156
Excuse me for speaking so very candidly , but as this is intended only for ourselves , I do not see why I should weigh my words . <EOS>	89.7656478881836
Are you no longer my master , or have I ceased to be your slave ? ” Monte Cristo returned her smile . <EOS>	43.704017639160156

What say you , Morrel ! ” “ _Ma foi_ , he has an open look about him that pleases me , in spite of the singular remark he has made about me. ” “ Gentlemen , ” said Albert , “ Germain informs me that breakfast is ready . <EOS>	56.239654541015625
He knew , that I should arrive today at ten o ’ clock ; he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontainebleau . <EOS>	33.12424850463867
“ And why not ? ” demanded D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	8.065958023071289
With a little more heart , he might have been contented with this new conquest ; but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride . <EOS>	93.25275421142578

“ ’ Tis Raoul who has come back , ” said Athos ; “ and we can now hear how the poor child is. ” In fact , the young man appeared at the gate , covered with dust , entered the courtyard , leaped from his horse , which he consigned to the charge of a groom , and then went to greet the count and D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	28.360116958618164
“ You know well that I don ’ t like to leave things half finished. ” “ Conclude , then , sir , ” answered De Chatillon , with as much hauteur as Aramis . <EOS>	36.545677185058594
He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish . <EOS>	93.20087432861328
The count never plays , he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry , and is so rich that he can not , without intending to laugh at me , try to borrow money . <EOS>	84.04634094238281
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning , and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps . <EOS>	124.66548156738281
He went up to him , but , to his extreme astonishment , the stranger first addressed him . <EOS>	55.43684768676758
He returned thus , formidable and implacable , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand . <EOS>	85.59284210205078
Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up , and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop , so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès . <EOS>	366.3112487792969
Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who , a minute before , prepared apparently for a fight . <EOS>	100.51631927490234

At the same moment , whilst D ’ Artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen , a metallic sound , as if some one was moving a bag of gold , struck on his ear ; he started ; instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase . <EOS>	58.318946838378906

Mercédès remained , therefore , by his bedside , and M. Morrel went away , making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece ; but , availing himself of the doctor ’ s order , the old man would not take any sustenance ; at length ( after nine days of despair and fasting ) , the old man died , cursing those who had caused his misery , and saying to Mercédès , ‘ If you ever see my Edmond again , tell him I die blessing him. ’ ” The abbé rose from his chair , made two turns round the chamber , and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat . <EOS>	73.50828552246094

“ My dear host , and you , signora , ” said Albert , in Italian , “ excuse my apparent stupidity . <EOS>	36.5707893371582

“ Ah , ” replied he , sighing , “ that is not very surprising ; I have been more than a year absent from Paris , and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut ; the count takes me for a provincial . <EOS>	51.15351104736328

You must take a carriage and an escort , and guard the prisoner with the greatest care. ” D ’ Artagnan took the letter , touched his hat with his hand , turned round upon his heel like a drill-sergeant , and a moment afterward was heard , in his dry and monotonous tone , commanding “ Four men and an escort , a carriage and a horse. ” Five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses ’ shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard . <EOS>	60.583553314208984

“ In the first place , there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacieux. ” “ She is in the prison of Nantes. ” “ That is to say , she was there , ” replied Milady ; “ but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent. ” “ To a convent ? ” said the duke . <EOS>	27.074371337890625
This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans ; it was an entire army . <EOS>	70.67372131347656
“ Alas ! <EOS>	15.835620880126953
You are right ; it is not you alone this matter concerns , but my lord and his unworthy servant , myself. ” “ Well , then , what do you require besides the general conditions before recited ? ” “ I require , my lord , that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville , with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution . <EOS>	59.11701583862305
I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort , her devotion to the elder Dantès . <EOS>	53.73677062988281
I now understand why you are in the service of Cromwell ; you hate the king. ” “ Yes , my lord , I hate him ! ” said the young man . <EOS>	20.302898406982422

Milady fell down , and seemed to be in a swoon . <EOS>	26.943225860595703
I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively ; that it seems as if I had always known you , and always hated you ; and , in short , since the young people of the present day will not fight , it remains for us to do so . <EOS>	49.80577087402344

While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort , he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars , and he soon guessed all that had passed between them , though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars . <EOS>	55.703548431396484
“ Nothing would be more easy , ” said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail , “ but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal. ” “ I have that permission , ” said the gentleman , drawing the paper from his pocket ; “ here it is. ” “ Have it examined by the governor of the port , ” said the shipmaster , “ and give me the preference. ” “ Where shall I find the governor ? ” “ At his country house. ” “ And that is situated ? ” “ At a quarter of a league from the city . <EOS>	37.0284309387207
what has happened ? ” “ Lord ! ” ejaculated the young princess , falling on her knees , “ have mercy on us ! ” “ Sir , ” said Chatillon , “ if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen. ” Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him . <EOS>	44.4847412109375
The footsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and Dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this idea was soon converted into certainty , when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier . <EOS>	183.3901824951172
“ What vessel is that ? ” asked Milady . <EOS>	19.30153465270996
He moved away , walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts , and then went back and listened . <EOS>	66.62297058105469
What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth ? ” “ My fifty recruits from the Chevalier d ’ Humieres , who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks. ” “ And where are you going ? ” “ To the house of one of my friends , a sculptor , only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble. ” “ Very good , ” said Gondy , shaking Rochefort by the hand , who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him . <EOS>	71.54724884033203

Stay where you are ; I will go myself. ” And with a light step , an eye on the watch , observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground , D ’ Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier . <EOS>	75.83116149902344
“ You are examining my den , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	20.947555541992188
I am of your opinion , but find me a better one or give me the means of living. ” Athos was for a few moments thoughtful . <EOS>	48.94295883178711

I feel cramps over my whole body. ” “ Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Any noise in the ears ? ” “ Frightful. ” 40112m “ When did you first feel that ? ” “ Just now. ” “ Suddenly ? ” “ Yes , like a clap of thunder. ” “ Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before ? ” “ Nothing. ” “ No drowsiness ? ” “ None. ” “ What have you eaten today ? ” “ I have eaten nothing ; I only drank a glass of my master ’ s lemonade—that ’ s all. ” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier , who , immovably fixed in his armchair , was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him . <EOS>	56.56828689575195
“ Well , ” continued the latter , “ since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes , it is elsewhere , and I must go and find it. ” “ Go , ” said the count deliberately ; “ go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world , that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love , and that I love you , Morrel. ” 40260m “ I will remember it , ” said the young man , “ as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid . <EOS>	40.41141891479492

As they left Paris , an equipage with four horses , at full speed , was seen to draw up suddenly ; it contained Monte Cristo . <EOS>	66.92794799804688
The three friends were likewise greatly delighted . <EOS>	71.5622329711914
“ But , ” said Villefort , who was the first to break the silence , “ I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question . <EOS>	24.251649856567383
He was about to marry a young and charming woman , whom he loved , not passionately , but reasonably , as became a deputy attorney of the king ; and besides her personal attractions , which were very great , Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ’ s family possessed considerable political influence , which they would , of course , exert in his favor . <EOS>	93.10595703125
This was the departure of Fernand—of Fernand , whose crime she did not know , and whom she regarded as her brother . <EOS>	67.41447448730469
“ And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voiture ’ s works , but I am of the same opinion as the coadjutor—he is a poet , a true poet. ” Aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody . <EOS>	126.45266723632812
Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today ? ” “ A fine pleasure , indeed , monsieur ! <EOS>	61.0763053894043
Madame de Vernet was driven from me , Putange was exiled , Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace , and when you wished to come back as ambassador to France , the king himself—remember , my lord—the king himself opposed it. ” “ Yes , and France is about to pay for her king ’ s refusal with a war . <EOS>	106.77796173095703
If we ever escape together , half this treasure is yours ; if I die here , and you escape alone , the whole belongs to you. ” “ But , ” inquired Dantès hesitating , “ has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves ? ” “ No , no , be easy on that score ; the family is extinct . <EOS>	86.02603149414062
Hold ; see ! <EOS>	252.82876586914062
To lose a year , two years , three years , is to talk of an eternity ; to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal , perhaps ; to return when D ’ Artagnan and his friends , happy and triumphant , should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her—these were devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure . <EOS>	105.44850158691406
I do not know why , but I imagine that this woman , wholly unknown to me as she is , and wholly unknown to her as I am , has an influence over my life. ” “ Well , perhaps you are right , ” said Athos . <EOS>	30.093774795532227
Then , all at once , he replied , with that logic which the reader has , doubtless , remarked in him , “ There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn ; instead of being astonished , let me dress myself. ” And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris . <EOS>	98.79694366455078
But what the devil are you about , Aramis ? ” continued Athos . <EOS>	20.345117568969727
What has the count done ? <EOS>	45.9726676940918
D ’ Artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off . <EOS>	45.339168548583984
But I wonder she is not here . <EOS>	76.59859466552734
Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived , the one accompanied by the porter , the other by Ali , and were received by the Abbé Busoni , who was praying by the side of the corpse . <EOS>	35.52092742919922

In the street of Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of Quinze-Vingts . <EOS>	97.5179672241211
On entering the hotel D ’ Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire . <EOS>	27.195556640625
Madame Broussel , separated by the width of the table from her husband , burst into tears , and the young girls clung to their father ’ s arms . <EOS>	47.2708854675293
“ Then not a word , but set to work ! ” They went on through the darkness , silent as phantoms ; they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees . <EOS>	72.38572692871094

Dantès had been flung into the sea , and was dragged into its depths by a thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet . <EOS>	76.22701263427734
It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman , or rather Frenchwoman—for I am convinced she was born in France , though I have not questioned her. ” “ That ring comes from Milady ? ” cried Athos , with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion . <EOS>	60.299583435058594
Take care of the executioner , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ All right . <EOS>	45.43647384643555
“ By-the-bye , ” continued D ’ Artagnan , “ should this man attempt to fly or to call out , pass your sword through his body. ” The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter , and D ’ Artagnan went out , followed by Bernouin . <EOS>	53.044227600097656
“ Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris , ” replied Caderousse . <EOS>	26.309720993041992
On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens , the sentinel cried out , “ Who ’ s there ? ” and D ’ Artagnan answered—having first asked the word of the cardinal— “ Louis and Rocroy. ” After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost . <EOS>	171.16429138183594
This succor , which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes , inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurator ’ s wife . <EOS>	65.67884063720703
We have undergone a great deal of fatigue , remember , and a little rest will do no harm. ” “ I rest ? <EOS>	73.09471893310547
“ Or , rather , who pretend not to understand me , sir ! ” replied the prisoner , with a smile of incredulity . <EOS>	31.230138778686523

“ The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Condé , although I must add ’ tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs. ” “ Yes , ” answered Athos , “ but his right place is in our ranks , with the Prince de Conti , De Beaufort , D ’ Elbeuf , and De Bouillon ; but , sir , supposing that the conference is broken off—are you going to try to take Charenton ? ” “ Such are my orders. ” “ Sir , since you command the cavalry—— ” “ Pardon me , I am commander-in-chief. ” “ So much the better . <EOS>	56.32872772216797

When they spoke , although Teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier , as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his language was that of praise , it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him , and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination . <EOS>	130.28201293945312

The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy , and subsequently , when I learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people , and the entire life of individuals in the East , as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair , I have regretted that I was not a man , that I might have been a Flamel , a Fontana , or a Cabanis. ” “ And the more , madame , ” said Monte Cristo , “ as the Orientals do not confine themselves , as did Mithridates , to make a cuirass of his poisons , but they also made them a dagger . <EOS>	94.07086181640625

“ It vexes me greatly , ” continued Athos , “ that you attach so much importance to these animals , for I am not yet at the end of my story. ” “ What else have you done. ” “ After having lost my own horse , nine against ten—see how near—I formed an idea of staking yours. ” “ Yes ; but you stopped at the idea , I hope ? ” “ No ; for I put it in execution that very minute. ” “ And the consequence ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , in great anxiety . <EOS>	48.33491897583008

Upon my word ! <EOS>	67.33599090576172
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly ; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword . <EOS>	153.24774169921875
Indeed , the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping . <EOS>	168.30908203125
After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket ; he found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto . <EOS>	68.56517028808594
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from La Rochelle , headed by the Prince de Soubise , and introduced him into a closet where Buckingham , just out of the bath , was finishing his toilet , upon which , as at all times , he bestowed extraordinary attention . <EOS>	115.1294937133789
You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me. ” “ Come , now , ” said Athos , “ you are joking. ” “ In that case , my dear friend , if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose ; the drum beats ; I observed cannon on the road ; I saw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville ; certainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton , as the Duc de Chatillon said. ” “ I supposed , ” said Athos , “ that last night ’ s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements. ” “ No doubt ; but they will fight , none the less , if only to mask the conferences. ” “ Poor creatures ! ” said Athos , “ who are going to be killed , in order that Monsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him , that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort , and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal. ” “ Come , come , dear Athos , confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this affair. ” “ Perhaps you speak the truth , Aramis. ” “ Well , let us go , then , where the fighting is , for that is the most likely place to meet with D ’ Artagnan , Porthos , and possibly even Raoul . <EOS>	53.24521255493164
The day after the event , she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance ; they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain. ” “ Oh , it is terrible ! ” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation , after expressing acute sympathy with the father . <EOS>	125.26810455322266
You were seated upon cushions in the Spanish fashion ; you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver , hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds . <EOS>	275.1418151855469
He seemed scarcely five-and-thirty . <EOS>	212.43344116210938
“ Does your honor want a horse ? ” asked Mousqueton . <EOS>	25.052932739257812

One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner : “ If I had listened to you , ” Lord de Winter had said to Felton . <EOS>	38.40257263183594
“ An order to conduct you to a room , and to leave you there to talk to me. ” “ Oh , ” cried Andrea , leaping with joy . <EOS>	30.003599166870117
The table and chair had nothing , the pail had once possessed a handle , but that had been removed . <EOS>	102.29170989990234
“ My dear count , you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus , ” said Morcerf . <EOS>	38.50654983520508
One can say anything to me . <EOS>	36.58710861206055

“ The celebrated Cucumetto , pursued in the Abruzzo , driven out of the kingdom of Naples , where he had carried on a regular war , had crossed the Garigliano , like Manfred , and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno . <EOS>	101.24421691894531
“ Madame ! ” exclaimed Athos , “ what were you saying just now about growing old ? <EOS>	40.995208740234375
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness . <EOS>	48.75288009643555
On his side Buckingham , in pretending to maintain the honor of England , was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal . <EOS>	121.27733612060547
Permit me , then , my dear Athos , without inquiring further about our friend , to pay my respects to M. Planchet. ” “ Ah , monsieur le chevalier , ” said Planchet , bowing . <EOS>	43.061126708984375
Of this treaty , at least , I have been warned . <EOS>	48.7921257019043
Happily for him he has ceased to bear that name. ” “ And therefore , ” said D ’ Artagnan , resolved to be patient to the end , “ it is not Aramis I seek , but the Abbé d ’ Herblay . <EOS>	37.55667495727539
The diminutive Abbé Scarron , who , however , was an abbé only because he owned an abbey , and not because he was in orders , had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans , which he inhabited . <EOS>	94.24057006835938
One day , when he arrived with his head in the air , and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold , he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the hôtel ; but this time the pretty Kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed , she took him gently by the hand . <EOS>	65.05355834960938

Then taking a paper out of his pocket , he unfolded it slowly . <EOS>	48.73040771484375
“ Come my brother , go with me , ” added D ’ Artagnan , “ and I will see that you are made a duke ! ” “ No , ” answered Porthos , “ Mouston has no desire to fight ; besides , they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony , which will kill my neighbors with envy. ” “ To that I can say nothing , ” returned D ’ Artagnan , who knew the vanity of the new baron . <EOS>	32.116661071777344
“ That is right ; I recommend the cardinal to your attention. ” “ Make your mind easy , he is in good hands. ” Planchet went out , the curate remaining for a moment . <EOS>	44.577354431152344
“ Oh ! ” he said , taking up his hat , which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head , “ we will soon find out. ” “ In what way ? ” “ Why , the fair is on at Beaucaire , there are always jewellers from Paris there , and I will show it to them . <EOS>	29.484766006469727

Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde ; and Mazarin , in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach , had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving . <EOS>	144.07583618164062

Just then the door opened , and the jailer , addressing himself to Bertuccio , said : “ Excuse me , sir , but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner. ” “ And so closes our interview , ” said Andrea to the worthy steward ; “ I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil ! ” “ I will return tomorrow , ” said Bertuccio . <EOS>	53.49809265136719
“ Yes , madame , I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty . <EOS>	27.13255500793457

These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit ; there were Sicily pine-apples , pomegranates from Malaga , oranges from the Balearic Isles , peaches from France , and dates from Tunis . <EOS>	288.5545349121094
“ Yes , monsieur , I know only him. ” “ Well , but then , ” continued Athos , speaking half to himself , “ if I kill you , I shall have the air of a boy-slayer. ” “ Not too much so , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , with a bow that was not deficient in dignity , “ since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient. ” “ Very inconvenient , upon my word ; and you hurt me devilishly , I can tell you . <EOS>	32.485233306884766
A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos : “ If Athos knows where we are , if he opens communication with us , before long Athos will act. ” Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances , but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea , he understood . <EOS>	100.14960479736328
“ If I did not fear to fatigue you , ” said the general , evidently charmed with the count ’ s manners , “ I would have taken you to the Chamber ; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators. ” “ I shall be most grateful , monsieur , if you will , at some future time , renew your offer , but I have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess , and I will therefore wait. ” “ Ah , here is my mother , ” cried the viscount . <EOS>	43.458499908447266
Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor . <EOS>	107.49788665771484
nothing good , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , shaking his head . <EOS>	11.712764739990234
My private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side. ” “ Good ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan : “ in this direction I am satisfied. ” He pressed Aramis ’ s hand and went in search of Porthos . <EOS>	71.21280670166016
I bought some Spanish shares . <EOS>	122.07976531982422
Then he raised to his lips the repast that , like a voluntary Tantalus , he refused himself ; but he thought of his oath , and he would not break it . <EOS>	62.04450607299805
They ask my name , I can not give it , since my parents abandoned me . <EOS>	72.35318756103516
At length Villefort , the most composed of all , spoke : “ Sir , ” said he to Maximilian , “ you say you loved Valentine , that you were betrothed to her . <EOS>	34.62469482421875
You will restore them to her Majesty ; and as a last memorial ” —he looked round for some valuable object— “ you will add— ” He still sought ; but his eyes , darkened by death , encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton , still smoking with the blood spread over its blade . <EOS>	144.73362731933594
“ We are lost , ” said D ’ Artagnan , in the ear of Athos . <EOS>	8.298087120056152
Therefore , when , at dessert , upon a sign from D ’ Artagnan , Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone : “ Porthos , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ who will attend you in your campaigns ? ” “ Why , ” replied Porthos , “ Mouston , of course. ” This was a blow to D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	26.745849609375
“ No vampire , ” cried Beauchamp . <EOS>	28.319948196411133
And you say that Monsieur d ’ Artagnan was one of those four men ? ” “ He led the enterprise. ” “ And who were the others ? ” “ I leave it to Monsieur d ’ Artagnan to name them , my lord . <EOS>	20.434459686279297
The Comte de Wardes was announced , and D ’ Artagnan was introduced . <EOS>	18.327133178710938
He thought of Aramis , who , without possessing any greater advantages than himself , had formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse , who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day ; and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish , some in ambition , others in love , whilst others , either from chance , or from ill-luck , or from some natural defect or impediment , remain half-way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations . <EOS>	101.19561767578125
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground , bathed in a pool of blood . <EOS>	32.4886474609375
I could not help thinking so just now ; the idea came over my mind , and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance ; excuse the remark. ” “ I do not think it likely , sir ; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society , and we very seldom go out , ” said the young lady . <EOS>	72.25550842285156
“ Athos ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , wringing his hands . <EOS>	5.68569278717041
But although the jeweler had been mentioned first , it was the secretary who first made his appearance . <EOS>	109.5335464477539

And the four friends , guided by Mousqueton , took up the way toward the house , already almost restored to their former gayety ; for they were now , as Athos had said , all four once more united and of single mind . <EOS>	89.29889678955078

“ Sire , ” said Aramis , “ will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this ? ” “ Friends ! ” answered Charles , sadly , “ I have but three—one of twenty years , who has never forgotten me , and two of a week ’ s standing , whom I shall never forget . <EOS>	40.24509048461914

“ What are these things ? ” he asked . <EOS>	9.51773452758789
It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver-mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal ’ s baton which Condé threw , or did not throw , into the enemy ’ s line of battle at Fribourg . <EOS>	110.1881103515625

This is the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the following subject , which has not yet been treated upon , and in which I perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration— ‘ _Utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_. ’ ” D ’ Artagnan , whose erudition we are well acquainted with , evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de Tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D ’ Artagnan had received from the Duke of Buckingham . <EOS>	118.40453338623047

But , my Lord , think of what you ’ re about to do , and beware of going too far ! ” “ What do you say ? <EOS>	39.295841217041016
Besides , our supper can ’ t delay you much . <EOS>	123.1572265625
I can not tell you how long we remained in this state ; at that period I did not even know what time meant . <EOS>	41.67939758300781
We have learnt nothing , forgotten nothing ! <EOS>	187.18699645996094
Think for a moment . <EOS>	73.95524597167969
Then , turning towards Ali , he said , “ Let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady , that she may select those she prefers for her carriage . <EOS>	69.16536712646484
“ ‘ Let him have it—let him have it , ’ she said . <EOS>	71.0728759765625
Today is the 30th . <EOS>	169.36654663085938
I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight , sword in hand. ” “ Yes , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose ? ” “ Oh ! ” said Porthos , “ you can ’ t think that , D ’ Artagnan ! ” D ’ Artagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception , but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous . <EOS>	35.959529876708984
Had he better deny everything or tell everything ? <EOS>	349.83795166015625
The door immediately closed , and D ’ Artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity . <EOS>	32.12274932861328
Ah ! <EOS>	52.055419921875
Porthos fired ; the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle . <EOS>	88.58643341064453
More than two thousand persons had assisted , as at a spectacle , in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends—an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive . <EOS>	259.6473388671875
“ Now , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ you wouldn ’ t be sorry to understand the plot , would you , Porthos ? ” “ Well , no , not very. ” “ Well , then , we shall go down into the court. ” “ Yes. ” “ We shall take the place of those two fellows. ” “ Well ? ” “ We will walk back and forth. ” “ That ’ s a good idea , for it isn ’ t warm. ” “ In a moment the valet-de-chambre will call the guard , as he did yesterday and the day before. ” “ And we shall answer ? ” “ No , on the contrary , we shall not answer. ” “ As you please ; I don ’ t insist on answering. ” “ We will not answer , then ; we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence. ” “ Where shall we escort him ? ” “ Where he is going—to visit Athos . <EOS>	34.794429779052734
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party . <EOS>	35.518096923828125
But you were just speaking on a very interesting topic , Beauchamp. ” “ I ? ” “ Yes ; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine. ” “ Ah , yes , so I was . <EOS>	52.25864791870117
“ Well ? ” she said at length , “ do you not answer me ? ” “ I have but one question to ask you , —what do you intend to do ? ” “ I was going to ask you , ” replied the baroness with a beating heart . <EOS>	18.60018539428711
“ Yes , I have seen him , ” he replied , “ and he has handed this letter to me . <EOS>	15.920455932617188
“ My lord , Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party. ” “ And what is the origin of this name ? ” “ It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging—qui frondent—stones from the moats round Paris , young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears , only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned . <EOS>	259.6773986816406
“ Good ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan ; “ a quarter of an hour to go to the tent , a quarter of an hour to return ; it is more than we need. ” Then turning , without the least change of countenance , to Porthos , he said , looking him full in the face : “ Friend Porthos , listen to this ; first , not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard ; it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them. ” “ Very well ; I understand. ” “ Go to the stable ; you will find Mousqueton there ; saddle your horses , put your pistols in your saddle-bags , take out the horses and lead them to the street below this , so that there will be nothing to do but mount them ; all the rest is my business. ” Porthos made no remark , but obeyed , with the sublime confidence he had in his friend . <EOS>	56.4453125
Pardon me for interrupting you , but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me. ” “ Possibly , monsieur . <EOS>	36.70188903808594
“ I say we have been here eighty-three hours. ” “ ’ Tis your fault , ” answered Porthos . <EOS>	32.271602630615234
And the thing was so much the more annoying , as , according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman , Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him , and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs . <EOS>	97.67740631103516
“ I am lost ! ” was his second thought ; and , indeed , for a man in Andrea ’ s situation , an arrest meant the assizes , trial , and death , —death without mercy or delay . <EOS>	102.57318878173828
The duke has had many affairs of gallantry ; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy , he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities. ” “ No doubt , ” said Milady , coolly , “ such a woman may be found. ” “ Well , such a woman , who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic , would save France. ” “ Yes ; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination. ” “ Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known ? ” “ No ; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were . <EOS>	101.7734603881836
Ah ! <EOS>	33.53022003173828
40064m Albert had proceeded no farther than the door , where he remained rooted to the spot , being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty , beheld as it was for the first time , and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea . <EOS>	132.758056640625
Ah , monsieur , he was no longer a man , he was a devil ! <EOS>	32.166439056396484
“ Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for ? ” The voice became more and more indistinct ; a tumultuous movement shook the partition . <EOS>	65.85630798339844
We will snatch some supper ; we shall perhaps travel part of the night , and must keep our strength up. ” “ Great God ! ” said Mme . <EOS>	62.59908676147461
“ It is a prisoner , ” said Edmond joyfully . <EOS>	21.21763038635254
Long swords but light purses . <EOS>	1227.8424072265625
The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace ; for like all galley-slaves , you said , ‘ I may escape from prison , I can not from the grave. ’ And you said truly ; the way was opened for you unexpectedly . <EOS>	165.2206268310547
confound it ! ” cried the Gascon , trying in vain , too late , to retract the thrust . <EOS>	78.14106750488281
“ But , my dear count , has M. Danglars any reason ? ” “ Ah ! <EOS>	21.65485954284668
The circumstances that had hastened the return of D ’ Artagnan to Paris were as follows : One evening , when Mazarin , according to custom , went to visit the queen , in passing the guard-chamber he heard loud voices ; wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing , he approached with his wonted wolf-like step , pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink . <EOS>	99.63997650146484
Bonacieux . <EOS>	68.5792236328125
On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start . <EOS>	158.5283966064453
“ Buckingham in Paris ! ” cried he , “ and why does he come ? ” “ To conspire , no doubt , with your enemies , the Huguenots and the Spaniards. ” “ No , _pardieu_ , no ! <EOS>	30.927518844604492
“ Then I saw that they took me for the assassin . <EOS>	30.91962242126465
Do you wish to go to M. Danglars ? <EOS>	26.04376792907715
Morrel does not know my name ; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of Rome , with whom your father does business. ” The young girl turned pale and continued to descend , while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the staircase . <EOS>	57.15011978149414
“ Ah , traitor ! ” muttered D ’ Artagnan , leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear , “ you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse. ” Chapter XXIX . <EOS>	28.39217185974121
The two witnesses followed . <EOS>	67.9041519165039
Morrel rose tremblingly , supporting himself by the arm of the chair . <EOS>	53.699180603027344
“ Pardieu ! <EOS>	27.441816329956055
“ If only we two arrive , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ it will be enough , since the duke ’ s troop are only four in number. ” “ That is true , ” said Porthos And he spurred his courser on . <EOS>	35.53191375732422
Rise and answer. ” Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz . <EOS>	227.07969665527344
And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian , who received him with great coldness . <EOS>	73.66077423095703
“ Ah ! <EOS>	10.56937026977539
Athos , according to his system , neither encouraged nor dissuaded him . <EOS>	80.28160095214844
Workmen were immediately called in , and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house . <EOS>	225.02212524414062
Two hours afterwards he came on deck , as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba . <EOS>	41.11519241333008
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage . <EOS>	68.92134857177734
“ _Corbleu ! _ I am more your friend than you think—for after our very first encounter , I could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut ! ” They this time embraced heartily , and without retaining any malice . <EOS>	167.670166015625
Let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal , and how he likes ; but the queen is sacred , and if anyone speaks of her , let it be respectfully. ” “ Porthos , you are as vain as Narcissus ; I plainly tell you so , ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	70.0980224609375
Are you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter ? <EOS>	113.88182830810547
“ Do you know , ” said Porthos , “ that to twist that damned Milady ’ s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of Huguenots , who have committed no other crime than singing in French the psalms we sing in Latin ? ” “ What says the abbé ? ” asked Athos , quietly . <EOS>	83.1373519897461
“ That poor child , ” said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone , “ she makes me very uneasy , and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness. ” Meanwhile , Valentine , in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand , had crossed Edward ’ s room without noticing some trick of the child , and through her own had reached the little staircase . <EOS>	56.177337646484375
“ Do you require my services now ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny . <EOS>	15.190488815307617
Light me , M. Bertuccio , and go first ; we will see where it leads to. ” “ Monsieur , ” replied Bertuccio , “ it leads to the garden. ” “ And , pray , how do you know that ? ” “ It ought to do so , at least. ” “ Well , let us be sure of that. ” Bertuccio sighed , and went on first ; the stairs did , indeed , lead to the garden . <EOS>	31.957563400268555
Have you traded it for your diamond ? ” “ No . <EOS>	35.3858528137207
The captain glanced at him , but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure , that suspicions , if the captain had any , died away . <EOS>	109.91753387451172
The night was dark , snow was falling , the streets were silent and deserted . <EOS>	97.3165054321289
“ What are you about ? ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	4.960149765014648
“ Poor Athos ! ” said he ; “ he will never guess what all this means . <EOS>	31.398576736450195
D ’ Artagnan returned and again attacked him . <EOS>	40.841800689697266
At this instant the door opened . <EOS>	12.167092323303223
Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation , and asked D ’ Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in England . <EOS>	55.220481872558594
“ Your affectionate “ ANNE ” Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter ; then , when it was ended , as if he had met with a bitter disappointment , he asked , “ Have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice , Laporte ? ” “ The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself , for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted. ” “ And is that all—is that all ? ” replied Buckingham , impatiently . <EOS>	62.82207107543945
I will be silent , but you must endure your captivity quietly . <EOS>	50.501380920410156
The sergeant had not the courage to reply ; he showed him the open door , the empty room . <EOS>	61.61088943481445
A Florentine adventurer , sire , and that was all ; while the august spouse of your Majesty is Anne of Austria , Queen of France—that is to say , one of the greatest princesses in the world. ” “ She is not the less guilty , Monsieur Duke ! <EOS>	80.12744140625
On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne , it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects. ” “ To the point , sir , ” said the queen , “ to the point , and answer me , yes or no ; if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor ? <EOS>	85.71807098388672
“ Well , M. de Villefort , how would you advise me to act ? ” asked he . <EOS>	16.549047470092773
“ Yes. ” These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos , each with a sadder intonation . <EOS>	117.08256530761719
“ I am glad to see , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that you have still that honest lad with you. ” “ He is my steward , ” replied Porthos ; “ he will never leave me . <EOS>	15.38334846496582
Had Fernand really meant to kill himself , he would have done so when he parted from Mercédès . <EOS>	93.20923614501953
“ That ’ s a snare , ” said Athos ; “ don ’ t go , D ’ Artagnan. ” “ And yet , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ I think I recognize the writing. ” “ It may be counterfeit , ” said Athos . <EOS>	11.120634078979492
Bernouin introduced him . <EOS>	81.0417709350586
“ What has happened ? ” “ All sorts of misfortunes. ” “ What ? ” “ In the first place , Monsieur Athos is arrested. ” “ Arrested ! <EOS>	18.72645378112793
“ Pooh ! ” replied D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	6.482955455780029
“ Has this woman been relating her crimes to you ? <EOS>	84.98905944824219

The young woman complied . <EOS>	49.791690826416016
Before daybreak he would awake , leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill , and reaching the forest , he would , under pretence of making studies in painting , test the hospitality of some peasants , procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet , casting off the lion ’ s skin to assume that of the woodman ; then , with his hands covered with dirt , his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb , his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe , he intended , by following the wooded districts , to reach the nearest frontier , walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries , and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time . <EOS>	180.45669555664062
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the helm . <EOS>	300.390380859375
“ Not here , ” he said ; “ doubtless she is in her bedroom. ” He rushed towards the door , found it bolted , and stopped , shuddering . <EOS>	28.894817352294922
“ If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond , and there existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni , then , indeed , I was lost past redemption , or , at least , my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth . <EOS>	143.5594482421875

“ Sir , ” cried Morrel , seizing the moist hand of the paralytic , “ they ask me who I am , and what right I have to be here . <EOS>	22.809545516967773

They reached Saint German without any accident ; on descending , the queen found the prince awaiting her , bare-headed , to offer her his hand . <EOS>	125.77481842041016

I prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear. ” “ Monsieur does me wrong , ” said Planchet ; “ I thought he had seen me at work. ” “ Yes , but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time. ” “ Monsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left ; only I beg Monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long. ” “ Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening ? ” “ I hope so , monsieur. ” “ Well , then , I count on you. ” “ At the appointed hour I shall be ready ; only I believed that Monsieur had but one horse in the Guard stables. ” “ Perhaps there is but one at this moment ; but by this evening there will be four. ” “ It appears that our journey was a remounting journey , then ? ” “ Exactly so , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; and nodding to Planchet , he went out . <EOS>	67.7650375366211

“ On the contrary , ” observed D ’ Artagnan , with a vexed look ; “ it would be impossible. ” “ How so ? ” “ It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to England. ” “ Well , suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go and join our friends ? ” said Porthos , with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army . <EOS>	36.8958740234375

You know it is you alone whom I love. ” “ How can I know that ? ” “ By the scorn I will throw upon her. ” D ’ Artagnan took a pen and wrote : MADAME , Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed , so unworthy did I feel myself of such an honor ; besides , I was so seriously indisposed that I could not in any case have replied to them . <EOS>	62.4758415222168
“ I shall kneel down to pray ; do not strike then. ” “ When shall I strike ? ” “ When I shall lay my head on the block and say ‘ Remember ! ’ then strike boldly. ” “ Gentlemen , ” said the king to those around him , “ I leave you to brave the tempest ; I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms . <EOS>	73.13697814941406

It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill. As for you , although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves , I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field. ” Valentine colored . <EOS>	103.87730407714844
Mazarin leaned out of the window . <EOS>	29.32087516784668
It is the work of another age , constructed by the genii of earth and water. ” “ How so ? —at what period can that have been ? ” “ I do not know ; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven built expressly , and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked . <EOS>	102.58649444580078

“ At least , ” D ’ Artagnan said to himself , as he took the road to Villars-Cotterets , “ at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking . <EOS>	20.467493057250977
Besides , his intention was formed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies , but without meanness or weakness , fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened—if conquered , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; if a conqueror , he is accused of foul play and want of courage . <EOS>	257.6021728515625
But I could find nothing—absolutely nothing . <EOS>	187.54803466796875

and not without a deal of trouble , too. ” “ Has the executioner left London ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	42.60602951049805
This plan succeeded ; and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him , excusing himself for having made his excellency wait , scolding the waiters , taking the candlestick from the porter , who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to Albert , when Morcerf himself appeared . <EOS>	105.6263427734375

Yes , you are at once from Provence and Spain ; that explains , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue I so much admired on the visage of the noble Catalan. ” It would have required the penetration of Œdipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness . <EOS>	145.00648498535156
“ Unfortunately , ” said Monte Cristo , “ one ’ s title to a millionaire does not last for life , like that of baron , peer of France , or academician ; for example , the millionaires Franck & Poulmann , of Frankfurt , who have just become bankrupts. ” “ Indeed ? ” said Danglars , becoming pale . <EOS>	62.73884963989258

At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay ; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman , who , having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels , was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill ; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs . <EOS>	136.29766845703125

Valentine , when her name was made the subject of discussion , had stepped back , to escape unpleasant observation ; her eyes were cast down , and she was crying . <EOS>	88.41944122314453
If you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say , ‘ No , my daughter is not guilty ; —there is no crime in my house . <EOS>	73.60929870605469
“ Well , then , madame , yes , I did feel fear ; and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I can not count how many charges and skirmishes , I own for the third time in my life I was afraid . <EOS>	88.74540710449219

The baron took the young officer by the arm , and turned his head over his shoulder , so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out . <EOS>	37.80030822753906
Guides are useful people , who will turn their hands to anything . <EOS>	306.3115539550781
I shall know about that soon , for I shall soon speak out to Athos. ” Day was now advanced ; all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened , one after the other . <EOS>	89.97391510009766
“ Yes , sir , ” replied Mousqueton . <EOS>	7.854635238647461
Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle ’ s place , and cardinal , like Mazarin ; and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal . <EOS>	174.1139373779297
Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall ? <EOS>	239.27064514160156
It was easy to ascertain this ; but how could he risk the question ? <EOS>	53.964134216308594
D ’ Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand , and fell on his knees before his mistress . <EOS>	33.87239456176758
The two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand-daughter of Henry IV. , the wife and daughter of Charles I . <EOS>	199.6627960205078
“ _Pardieu_ , ” resumed the latter , twisting his mustache , “ look at me as long as you like , my little gentleman ! <EOS>	33.90348434448242

“ Become of whom ? ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	32.43151092529297
There , caressing as he pretended , the animal with his hand , he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear . <EOS>	80.52735900878906
He then returned to the captain , said a few words to him , and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command , he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately . <EOS>	58.05730056762695

“ You arrive in good time , monsieur , ” said the king , who , when his passions were raised to a certain point , could not dissemble ; “ I have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers. ” “ And I , ” said Tréville , coldly , “ I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen. ” “ What ? ” said the king , with hauteur . <EOS>	36.7797737121582

Come , Guitant , come along , and let ’ s see if they keep watch at the Quinze-Vingts as at the Barriere des Sergens. ” And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D ’ Artagnan , who instantly put himself at the head of his troop , followed by the cardinal , Guitant and the rest of the escort . <EOS>	58.325538635253906
There was , indeed , reason to retreat , to be alarmed , and to scream . <EOS>	61.35023880004883
“ Does he often go to Auteuil ? ” added he . <EOS>	37.98936462402344
“ As to what you say about not seeing you again , I believe not a word of it ; with such a heart as yours—and such a sword—one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times , unscathed and unalarmed . <EOS>	119.0914306640625
I should like , however , to know what this letter addressed to Tréville contains. ” And the stranger , muttering to himself , directed his steps toward the kitchen . <EOS>	54.378822326660156
I examined the thicket with my dark lantern ; it was empty . <EOS>	53.638450622558594
“ Sir , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , without using any circumlocution , and as if fearing she had no time to lose , “ you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child ? ” “ Yes , madame , ” replied Villefort , “ it is not only projected but arranged. ” “ Your intended son-in-law is named M.

It was an order the count had just given , for immediately Ali went noiselessly , and returned , bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat . <EOS>	93.35196685791016
One night , however , I heard his sobs , and I could not resist my desire to go up to him , but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying . <EOS>	52.714195251464844
There , to his great astonishment , D ’ Artagnan heard the policy which made all Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly , as well as the private life of the cardinal , which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into . <EOS>	132.00152587890625
What have I done , then ? <EOS>	24.36979866027832
As for Franz , he remained at Florence , and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine , and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility , he took a fancy into his head ( having already visited Corsica , the cradle of Bonaparte ) to visit Elba , the waiting-place of Napoleon . <EOS>	130.959228515625
Two days previously , the article had appeared in another paper besides _ l ’ Impartial_ , and , what was more serious , one that was well known as a government paper . <EOS>	135.158203125

In fact , I am dead . <EOS>	17.629003524780273
At length he raised his head , fixed his eagle look upon that loyal , open , and intelligent countenance , read upon that face , furrowed with tears , all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month , and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty-one years before him , and what resources his activity , his courage , and his shrewdness might offer to a good master . <EOS>	107.69782257080078
Is there any crime in this request ? ” “ No , sire. ” “ Then you will appear ? ” “ Yes , sire. ” “ That is well , ” said the king , retiring , “ that is well ; I count upon it. ” The queen made a curtsy , less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her . <EOS>	34.767696380615234
I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics . <EOS>	65.1716079711914

“ Madame de Villefort is ill. ” 50087m “ But Mademoiselle de Villefort—— ” stammered the nurse . <EOS>	50.53434371948242
Milady , who had arisen , threw herself quickly into the armchair , her head thrown back , her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled , her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace , one hand on her heart , and the other hanging down . <EOS>	94.07125854492188
That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful apparition . <EOS>	275.44427490234375
“ I think I hear a noise , ” she said ; “ leave me. ” “ Good-bye , for the present , ” replied the count , walking upon tiptoe towards the library door , and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl ’ s heart was filled with gratitude . <EOS>	34.29715347290039
It was , however , necessary to affect weakness and pain—not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady . <EOS>	143.85643005371094
I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of the 27th of September , 1817 , and that I am the son of the procureur , M. de Villefort . <EOS>	36.858909606933594
But , hush , here comes somebody. ” “ ’ Tis Caderousse , who has heard of your arrival , and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return. ” “ Ah , lips that say one thing , while the heart thinks another , ” murmured Edmond . <EOS>	102.4653549194336
Vampa was twelve , and Teresa eleven . <EOS>	154.58082580566406
“ Ah , you have a noble heart , ” said the count ; “ so much the better. ” This exclamation , which corresponded to the count ’ s own thought rather than to what Albert was saying , surprised everybody , and especially Morrel , who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder . <EOS>	37.954933166503906
“ He ’ s a fine looking fellow , ” said another ; “ if he had only a comb and hair-grease , he ’ d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids. ” “ His coat looks nearly new , and his boots are brilliant . <EOS>	124.40010070800781

Confess ; you know I have the right of giving absolution. ” “ I , monseigneur ? ” said Athos . <EOS>	45.33949279785156
“ And now , Raoul , ” said the Gascon , “ Monsieur du Vallon and I are going away as ambassadors , where , I know not ; but should you want anything , write to Madame Turquaine , at La Chevrette , Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker—with economy ; for it is not so well filled as that of Monsieur d ’ Emery. ” And having , meantime , embraced his ward , he passed him into the robust arms of Porthos , who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant . <EOS>	69.37799072265625
“ It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color , and he was condemned by the Bey to have his tongue cut out , and his hand and head cut off ; the tongue the first day , the hand the second , and the head the third . <EOS>	100.68833923339844
“ Well , after all , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ supposing that he lives , that he comes to Paris ; we have seen many other such . <EOS>	20.54092025756836

“ Isn ’ t this fox a genius , Athos ? ” asked the Gascon . <EOS>	52.4499626159668
And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine , they will require no more of you ; nay , perhaps you will even have a double reward. ” “ I , madame , I ? ” cried Felton . <EOS>	68.6424331665039
Oh , those figures , how well I remember them ! <EOS>	93.06121063232422
Are you satisfied ? ” “ Well , ” said Felton , “ till tonight. ” And he darted out of the room , shut the door , and waited in the corridor , the soldier ’ s half-pike in his hand , and as if he had mounted guard in his place . <EOS>	21.69420051574707
What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude ! ” “ That is right , ” cried the marquise . <EOS>	42.76737976074219
Then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor . <EOS>	206.00567626953125
There only they explained to them the matter in hand . <EOS>	118.54395294189453
We beg them to take one step backward , and to transport themselves , the morning of that day of great catastrophes , into the showy , gilded salon we have before shown them , and which was the pride of its owner , Baron Danglars . <EOS>	142.38819885253906
“ Ah , wretch ! ” cried she , “ you have basely betrayed me , and still more , you have my secret ! <EOS>	28.686365127563477
Some ham , my boy , or we can ’ t drink. ” “ And her brother ? ” added D ’ Artagnan , timidly . <EOS>	29.479015350341797
This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you , my dear count . <EOS>	39.68415832519531
“ A fine thing , indeed ! ” grunted Porthos . <EOS>	36.33152770996094
“ The very same . <EOS>	51.06697082519531

Then , commencing a loud whistling noise , he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes ; then , undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage , Ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count ’ s chariot , took the reins in his hands , and mounted the box , when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses , he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start ; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated “ dappled grays , ” now changed into a couple of dull , sluggish , stupid brutes , was a slow , pottering pace , kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré . <EOS>	197.46080017089844
The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general , and he rushed on his adversary . <EOS>	109.89630889892578
I learn this desire , or rather I suspect that you feel it ; and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing , I send one of my officers to meet you , I place a carriage at his orders , and he brings you hither to this castle , of which I am governor , whither I come every day , and where , in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other , I have prepared you a chamber . <EOS>	86.59117126464844
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond , worth five or six thousand livres , which he wore on his finger ; and even this diamond—supposing that D ’ Artagnan , in his projects of ambition , wished to keep it , to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen—had not in the meanwhile , since he could not part with it , more value than the gravel he trod under his feet . <EOS>	69.38990020751953

‘ I have seen his servant , ’ said one , and that applies very well to me. ” “ Well ? ” “ ‘ He must certainly be at Noisy , or be coming there this evening , ’ said the other ; and that applies very well to you. ” “ What else ? ” “ Then the prince said : ‘ Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier ; ’ which seems to me to leave no room for doubt , since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers . <EOS>	49.59716796875
Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way , and crossing the Pont Neuf , still driving the two sorry animals before him , he reached the Rue aux Ours . <EOS>	97.2983627319336
“ What ! ” cried Porthos , “ are we all going away , then ? <EOS>	12.559992790222168
“ By the orders of the deputy procureur ? ” “ I believe so. ” The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort relieved all Dantès ’ apprehensions ; he advanced calmly , and placed himself in the centre of the escort . <EOS>	64.38939666748047

“ Oh , ” said Dantès timidly , “ what is the matter ? ” Villefort made no answer , but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds , and again perused the letter . <EOS>	19.77887725830078
“ That head has never conspired , ” murmured he , “ but it matters not ; we will see. ” “ You are accused of high treason , ” said the cardinal , slowly . <EOS>	38.63807678222656
During the reading of this , which was long , the public attention was continually drawn towards Andrea , who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern . <EOS>	175.56900024414062

It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic , and the way in which he had achieved the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased Edmond ’ s admiration of him ; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit , supposing it had ever existed , still existed ; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical , he yet believed it was no longer there . <EOS>	60.36632537841797

After having stood a few minutes in the cavern , the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp , Dantès ’ eye , habituated as it was to darkness , could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern , which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds . <EOS>	101.5928955078125

It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal , and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil . <EOS>	65.1676254272461
The queen and her minister , more especially the latter , had reason to feel anxious . <EOS>	97.88671112060547
“ Very well ; come this way. ” D ’ Artagnan went toward a very small , low window , just large enough to let a man through . <EOS>	103.14926147460938

“ Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villefort ’ s , ” said he ; “ and in passing , as she was thirsty , she drank what remained in the glass ; as for the decanter , Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks. ” Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke . <EOS>	63.51805877685547

But if he be willing to accept my offers , will you oppose them ? ” “ You well know , Edmond , that I am no longer a reasoning creature ; I have no will , unless it be the will never to decide . <EOS>	66.15262603759766
Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role . <EOS>	63.95503234863281
it is not the king ! ” exclaimed the cavalier . <EOS>	18.25066566467285
Beauchamp repeated the name to himself , as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright , and then gave orders for him to be admitted . <EOS>	40.98937225341797
“ I , too , ” said the young man , “ am a musician—at least , my masters used to tell me so ; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other , and a soprano less than any. ” Danglars smiled , and seemed to say , “ It is of no consequence. ” Then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , — “ The prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday . <EOS>	65.55618286132812
At the voice of this last speaker , Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow . <EOS>	120.20623779296875
They obtained information at Ablain , and a statement of their route was left for Grimaud . <EOS>	152.7715301513672
Caderousse ’ s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes , and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest . <EOS>	205.49923706054688
I was expected at sharp midnight , and I am late. ” “ By five minutes. ” “ Yes ; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages. ” “ When one loves. ” “ Well ! <EOS>	73.05858612060547
And she began to shriek more loudly , clinging to the bars of the window : “ Help ! <EOS>	67.95063781738281
There came to the court an ambassador so brave , so magnificent , so elegant , that every woman lost her heart to him ; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them . <EOS>	102.37773895263672
Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , “ The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has. ” Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow . <EOS>	197.8909149169922
At one of these encounters , accidentally or purposely , Albert ’ s mask fell off . <EOS>	78.84272003173828
Faith , no , for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice. ” “ But I , ” cried Morrel , groaning with sorrow , “ I love her ! ” “ You love ? —whom ? ” cried Monte Cristo , starting to his feet , and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven . <EOS>	47.56638717651367
When he had gained the angle of the street , he turned . <EOS>	24.202661514282227
The agent arose , and having bowed to Lord Wilmore , who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the English , he retired . <EOS>	61.01933670043945
So , once more , good-night. ’ Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold . <EOS>	125.3150634765625
d ’ Épinay , ” said he , “ allow me to remind you at this moment , —which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear , for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb , —allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her death-bed , that Valentine ’ s wedding might not be deferred . <EOS>	83.63417053222656
Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him , and he called a second and third time ; still no answer . <EOS>	108.77037811279297
At sight of this man , D ’ Artagnan started , and half drawing his sword , sprang toward the door . <EOS>	22.415531158447266
At precisely six o ’ clock the clatter of horses ’ hoofs was heard at the entrance door ; it was our captain of Spahis , who had arrived on Médéah . <EOS>	74.80577850341797
We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort . <EOS>	133.11582946777344
The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road , but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside . <EOS>	158.24510192871094

She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic . <EOS>	100.22212219238281
“ Ah , I have come now to what is most difficult. ” “ Speak , speak ! <EOS>	34.0513916015625
“ Or rather you insult me , ” continued she , pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair , and raising herself upon her wrists . <EOS>	61.44597625732422
“ Not one of them will do as he says , ” he murmured , with his little monkey smile ; “ but they may do as they please , the brave gentlemen ! <EOS>	44.00917434692383
everything considered , you are very well off here . <EOS>	101.13020324707031
I can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison ; only of this I am sure , I have dreamed he was dead , and you know my dreams never deceive me . <EOS>	88.97527313232422
I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful , with a face so pale. ” The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion ; he trembled all over ; he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask . <EOS>	114.19341278076172
“ Listen , then , ” returned Rochefort , as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal ’ s motive . <EOS>	39.64445114135742
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself . <EOS>	44.70616149902344
I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera ; and if you can , bring Château-Renaud with you. ” Beauchamp availed himself of Albert ’ s permission , and left him , promising to call for him at a quarter before eight . <EOS>	62.21378707885742
He saw a lady , a fashionable , elegantly dressed lady , and yet the door remained almost closed . <EOS>	147.5104217529297
Grimaud ’ s agitation , his pallor , the sweat which covered his face , the dust which soiled his clothes , all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news . <EOS>	87.00247955322266
When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things ; first , that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles , and secondly , that he had no money . <EOS>	92.7751693725586
Upon his return to the hotel , Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown and slippers , listlessly extended on a sofa , smoking a cigar . <EOS>	130.38392639160156
“ I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni. ” “ Well , when you receive the remaining 40,000 , you shall give me a receipt in full . <EOS>	55.72990417480469
They are not dead , for the death of D ’ Artagnan would make a sensation . <EOS>	34.119930267333984
At every noise he heard , the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms , to accuse herself , and die with him . <EOS>	103.3803482055664
“ Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs , ” said Lord Wilmore ; “ he is a miser. ” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman , who , knowing no other reproach to bring on the count , accused him of avarice . <EOS>	52.43474578857422
In what can I have offended her—I who ever since I have known her have lived at her feet like a slave ? <EOS>	132.5399627685547
“ No , but in the one next to it , and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing . <EOS>	61.661293029785156
His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past , of times present , and probably of times to come . <EOS>	161.57847595214844
“ Yes , to a convent. ” “ And to which ? ” “ I don ’ t know ; the secret has been well kept. ” “ But _I_ will know ! ” “ And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is ? ” “ I can see nothing inconvenient in that , ” said the cardinal . <EOS>	29.944034576416016
“ You will retract this assertion , will you not , Beauchamp ? ” said Albert with increased though stifled anger . <EOS>	65.17887878417969
“ Who are you ? ” asked the man . <EOS>	6.762706756591797
“ Yes. ” “ Well , as for me , I prefer Hannibal. ” “ And why , pray , Master La Ramee ? ” asked the duke . <EOS>	16.824748992919922
But he bethought him of M. de Villefort ’ s promise ; and , besides , death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible . <EOS>	78.58007049560547
“ Whose , then , is the air we breathe ? <EOS>	109.28547668457031
Is that all you want ? ” “ Yes. ” Valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier ’ s room . <EOS>	26.31476402282715
“ You are convinced now , Edmond , are you not ? ” asked the abbé . <EOS>	14.620595932006836
You have befouled the face of your king . <EOS>	96.58322143554688
“ Now , my wife came home four days ago , monsieur . <EOS>	42.20330047607422
he was alone again ! <EOS>	72.7022705078125
The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there ; but they had all been pensioned , or had passed on to some other employment . <EOS>	86.36346435546875
“ The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to M. de Morcerf , and is justified by his son ! <EOS>	47.09302520751953
Well , madame , it proved to be as we had supposed ; there was a mistake . <EOS>	60.71455764770508
The two friends met her in the corridor , greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events ; she called some of the nuns , who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men . <EOS>	138.99742126464844
“ That worthy prince . <EOS>	77.21662902832031
Why did you talk of a regiment , Athos ? <EOS>	54.56245422363281
how I have suffered ! ” said Milady , in that harmonious voice which , like that of the ancient enchantresses , charmed all whom she wished to destroy . <EOS>	68.82544708251953
Come and watch by the dead , and all the wretched family will be grateful to you. ” “ I am going , sir ; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine. ” D ’ Avrigny took the priest ’ s hand , and without meeting Villefort , who was engaged in his study , they reached Valentine ’ s room , which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers . <EOS>	39.09018325805664
This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome . <EOS>	62.65445327758789
Once in France he turned his course toward Paris , and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne . <EOS>	134.7234344482422
Section 1 . <EOS>	98.07139587402344
D ’ Avrigny accosted the priest . <EOS>	61.5897102355957
In the corridor he met Mme . <EOS>	40.817405700683594
He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker ’ s family , in which he had been received as a son , and where , besides , his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars . <EOS>	69.62299346923828
As he approached it , Noirtier ’ s gaze followed him , and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart . <EOS>	56.61516189575195
A crowd of masks flowed in from all sides , emerging from the doors , descending from the windows . <EOS>	90.986328125
Then , infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice , he addressed the inspector , and sought to inspire him with pity . <EOS>	74.71990203857422
The Pardon Chapter 117 . <EOS>	58.12017822265625
Oh , curses , woe , death to you ! ” He tried to follow Monte Cristo ; but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot , —his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets ; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood ; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary , and deluge his brain with living fire . <EOS>	150.22103881835938
“ We can only save you by being free ourselves , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , in a rapid , low tone ; “ and if we appear inclined to defend you , they will arrest us with you. ” “ It seems , nevertheless— ” “ Come , gentlemen , come ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , aloud ; “ I have no motive for defending Monsieur . <EOS>	26.751283645629883
I did hope ( man is a poor wretched creature ) , I did hope . <EOS>	168.1568145751953
Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star , and the walls , dug into niches , which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins , showed that they were at last in the catacombs . <EOS>	90.39431762695312
Then , according to foreign custom , the presentations took place . <EOS>	137.1256866455078
“ This instant , sir—this instant , I beseech you ! ” said the old lady . <EOS>	43.478118896484375
After the reward of his devotion , that of his love was to come . <EOS>	32.48048400878906
Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny , Morrel , to pray sometimes for a man , who , like Satan , thought himself for an instant equal to God , but who now acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom . <EOS>	184.8465118408203
‘ I bought , ’ said he , ‘ the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle ; whereas , on my honor , Monsieur de Chavigny , though I ’ ve been here a week , has not ordered so much as a tartlet. ’ ‘ But , ’ I then replied , ‘ probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good. ’ ‘ My pastry not good ! <EOS>	67.74199676513672
“ Ah , pardieu ! ” he exclaimed ; “ that would be fair play. ” And approaching the carriage , he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box . <EOS>	44.098880767822266
“ Now , in my turn , let me give you my instructions. ” “ I am all attention. ” “ Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre , on the side of the Rue de l ’ Echelle , and ask for Germain. ” “ Well , and then ? ” “ He will ask you what you want , and you will answer by these two words , ‘ Tours ’ and ‘ Bruxelles. ’ He will at once put himself at your orders. ” “ And what shall I command him ? ” “ To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte , the queen ’ s _valet de chambre_. ” “ And when he shall have informed him , and Monsieur Laporte is come ? ” “ You will send him to me. ” “ That is well ; but where and how shall I see you again ? ” “ Do you wish to see me again ? ” “ Certainly. ” “ Well , let that care be mine , and be at ease. ” “ I depend upon your word. ” “ You may. ” D ’ Artagnan bowed to Mme . <EOS>	33.82529830932617
If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman. ” The sailor departed without reply . <EOS>	132.3202667236328
That which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair , and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses . <EOS>	113.6943130493164
Then , certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders , she started her horse and disappeared . <EOS>	55.38434600830078
“ Well , sir , ” resumed Danglars , after a brief silence , “ I will endeavor to make myself understood , by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me ? ” “ Why , truly , ” replied Monte Cristo , determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained , “ my reason for desiring an ‘ unlimited ’ credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need. ” The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand . <EOS>	54.813907623291016
He is at Vincennes. ” “ Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort ? <EOS>	32.81269836425781
Then , patting the young girl on the head , he continued , “ Haydée is very courageous , and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes. ” “ Because , my lord , ” said Haydée eagerly , “ my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness. ” Albert looked at her with curiosity , for she had not yet related what he most desired to know , —how she had become the slave of the count . <EOS>	60.05564880371094
Ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him. ” “ Alas ! ” sighed Bazin . <EOS>	126.59504699707031

The conversation took a cheerful turn . <EOS>	96.49870300292969
D ’ Artagnan did the same . <EOS>	8.312975883483887
“ Yes , ” replied Noirtier . <EOS>	10.326359748840332
It is a misfortune , and government owes nothing to his family . <EOS>	55.07143783569336
I stand in need of being taught and consoled. ” “ Consoled for what ? ” “ For my misfortune. ” “ Your misfortune is laughable , ” said Athos , shrugging his shoulders ; “ I should like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a real tale of love ! ” “ Which has happened to you ? ” “ Or one of my friends , what matters ? ” “ Tell it , Athos , tell it. ” “ Better if I drink. ” “ Drink and relate , then. ” “ Not a bad idea ! ” said Athos , emptying and refilling his glass . <EOS>	37.90122985839844

“ Ah ! ” said Mousqueton , who had ridden by the side of D ’ Artagnan without speaking a word on the journey , “ you may think what you will , sir , but I can breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds ; ” and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends . <EOS>	34.99466323852539
Excitement , like enthusiasm , sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth . <EOS>	315.1414794921875
What do you mean by that , you idiot ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	18.624937057495117
The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance , yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said : “ You are Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ? ” “ I am that individual , ” replied the officer . <EOS>	46.96587371826172
He went and resumed his post , beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude . <EOS>	128.97802734375
Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew , as if with regret . <EOS>	167.234130859375
Meanwhile , Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase , which , being carpeted , prevented his approach being heard , and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort even would not have alarmed him . <EOS>	72.84142303466797
Albert took the letter , opened , and read it , then looked round for Bertuccio , but he was gone . <EOS>	35.962615966796875
Cries were soon heard , and then moans , which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle . <EOS>	134.0459747314453
It must be ; it shall be. ” Seizing a pen , he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk , and wrote at the bottom of the document ( which was no other than his will , made since his arrival in Paris ) a sort of codicil , clearly explaining the nature of his death . <EOS>	90.89678192138672
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair . <EOS>	203.76541137695312
“ Good , quite right ! ” cried Mordaunt , springing off his horse . <EOS>	25.74886131286621
“ Jump then , Monsieur Pistache. ” But Pistache , as at first , turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane . <EOS>	64.0052490234375
On her side , but as softly as possible , Kitty turned the key of the lock , and then D ’ Artagnan opened the closet door . <EOS>	47.43273162841797
Faith , you are indeed right not to return to it . <EOS>	85.78926086425781
“ How could this ring come into the hands of Milady Clarik ? <EOS>	57.44302749633789

Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen ; a Don Quixote without his corselet , without his coat of mail , without his cuisses ; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet , the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure ; face long and brown ; high cheek bones , a sign of sagacity ; the maxillary muscles enormously developed , an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected , even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather ; the eye open and intelligent ; the nose hooked , but finely chiseled . <EOS>	240.57244873046875
You shall place it on that table , and you may remain between it and me. ” Felton offered the weapon to Milady , who examined the temper of it attentively , and who tried the point on the tip of her finger . <EOS>	67.2908935546875
I know no better means than to act with candor . <EOS>	103.05432891845703
D ’ Artagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady ; it was a magnificent sapphire , encircled with brilliants . <EOS>	68.20084381103516
Yesterday I undertook to employ that cord which you see hanging against the wall , but pain prevented my continuing the pious exercise. ” “ That ’ s the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat-o ’ -nine-tails ; but you were ill , and illness renders the head weak , therefore you may be excused. ” “ When do you mean to set out ? ” “ Tomorrow at daybreak . <EOS>	162.40243530273438

My dear Franz , M. Maximilian Morrel , an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence , and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection , wit , or amiability. ” Morrel hesitated for a moment ; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing , but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory ; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz . <EOS>	99.1780014038086

But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie , he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered . <EOS>	76.84912109375
At the same minute , one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open , and the head of a gendarme appeared . <EOS>	29.68216323852539
Every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations . <EOS>	239.61190795898438

Mordaunt put his hand into the hat , took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it . <EOS>	51.09162902832031
When he had finished , he went to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses . <EOS>	65.4647216796875

She had one hope , which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour ; but Felton did not come . <EOS>	70.4576644897461

“ In heaven ’ s name ! ” cried the unhappy young man , “ if you doubt me , question me ; I will answer you. ” Villefort made a violent effort , and in a tone he strove to render firm : “ Sir , ” said he , “ I am no longer able , as I had hoped , to restore you immediately to liberty ; before doing so , I must consult the trial justice ; what my own feeling is you already know. ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” cried Dantès , “ you have been rather a friend than a judge. ” 0105m “ Well , I must detain you some time longer , but I will strive to make it as short as possible . <EOS>	47.534358978271484

The Guards , under the command of M. Dessessart , took up their quarters at the Minimes ; but , as we know , D ’ Artagnan , possessed with ambition to enter the Musketeers , had formed but few friendships among his comrades , and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections . <EOS>	70.01361083984375

Of this , however , be assured , that should any favorable opportunity present itself , I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present. ” “ For shame , M. de Villefort ! ” said Renée , becoming quite pale ; “ don ’ t you see how you are frightening us ? —and yet you laugh. ” “ What would you have ? <EOS>	44.56514358520508
The apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows , over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of France ; beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house . <EOS>	141.48338317871094
A short time since I passed through Marseilles , and went to see the old place , which revived so many painful recollections ; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure . <EOS>	59.23524475097656
Well , out of the five or six millions which form your real capital , you have just lost nearly two millions , which must , of course , in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune ; to follow out my simile , your skin has been opened by bleeding , and this if repeated three or four times will cause death—so pay attention to it , my dear Monsieur Danglars . <EOS>	161.49436950683594

“ ‘ Ah , I understand , ’ said the lieutenant ; ‘ and you seek admittance into our ranks ? ’ “ ‘ Welcome ! ’ cried several bandits from Ferrusino , Pampinara , and Anagni , who had recognized Luigi Vampa . <EOS>	55.241024017333984
I was induced to marry her about three years ago , although she had but very little dowry , because Monsieur Laporte , the queen ’ s cloak bearer , is her godfather , and befriends her. ” “ Well , monsieur ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	45.817386627197266
All I can say is , that if it be so , ’ tis an ill turn , and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it. ” “ Nonsense , ” returned Danglars , “ I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it ; besides , you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces. ” “ No , you did not ! ” answered Caderousse , “ you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner. ” “ Hold your tongue , you fool ! —what should you know about it ? —why , you were drunk ! ” “ Where is Fernand ? ” inquired Caderousse . <EOS>	69.96798706054688

“ And you , Porthos , ” continued the count , as if in consideration for D ’ Artagnan ’ s embarrassment , “ you , the best heart , the best friend , the best soldier that I know—you , with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne , and who , sooner or later , must receive your reward from an intelligent king—you , my dear Porthos , you , a gentleman in manners , in tastes and in courage , you are as culpable as D ’ Artagnan. ” Porthos blushed , but with pleasure rather than with confusion ; and yet , bowing his head , as if humiliated , he said : “ Yes , yes , my dear count , I feel that you are right. ” Athos arose . <EOS>	52.705509185791016
“ You will , of course , dispose of it in some way or other ? ” “ Yes. ” “ In favor of some member of your family ? ” “ No. ” “ Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes , then ? ” pursued the notary . <EOS>	39.12644577026367

At the moment when he was about to retire , she was cheered with a ray of hope , for she thought he was about to speak ; but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth , and making a powerful effort to control himself , he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips , and went out . <EOS>	42.375396728515625
“ In that case , ” replied the abbé , “ he should be a man blessed of God , rich , happy. ” Caderousse smiled bitterly . <EOS>	28.129959106445312

“ _Morbleu_ , monsieur ! ” said he , “ however far I may come , it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners , I warn you. ” “ Perhaps , ” said Athos . <EOS>	23.43100929260254

Why did you not tell me so before ? <EOS>	42.646297454833984
“ I have looked at it with all possible attention , ” said Dantès , “ and I only see a half-burnt paper , on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink. ” “ This paper , my friend , ” said Faria , “ I may now avow to you , since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure , of which , from this day forth , one-half belongs to you. ” The sweat started forth on Dantès ’ brow . <EOS>	70.55011749267578
At all events , it is best that he should follow us to Athos ’ s. ” Aramis called Bazin , and , after having ordered him to join them at Athos ’ s residence , said “ Let us go then , ” at the same time taking his cloak , sword , and three pistols , opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin . <EOS>	54.2109260559082
The king smiled , patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle . <EOS>	62.64988327026367

“ Ah , it is No , then ? ” “ Yes. ” Valentine fetched a dictionary , which she placed on a desk before Noirtier ; she opened it , and , seeing that the old man ’ s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages , she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns . <EOS>	49.105438232421875
Porthos had Bicarat , and Aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries . <EOS>	76.04389953613281
What could he say ? <EOS>	27.3447322845459
besides , if they do , we can easily make an excuse ; we came straight off a journey and are insurgents , too. ” “ An excuse for us ! <EOS>	70.5123519897461
“ Yes , mademoiselle , you especially , ” replied the doctor abruptly . <EOS>	28.25424575805664

The inspector listened attentively ; then , turning to the governor , observed , “ He will become religious—he is already more gentle ; he is afraid , and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of anything ; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton. ” Then , turning to the prisoner , “ What is it you want ? ” said he . <EOS>	73.96907043457031

You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs ; spend them if necessary , but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve , that is to say , like kings. ” The queen had two letters ready , one written by herself , the other by her daughter , the Princess Henrietta . <EOS>	107.56192779541016
“ What for ? ” demanded Porthos . <EOS>	15.275983810424805
I knew that from the mixture of Greek words . <EOS>	152.3966064453125
Speak , command , I will obey. ” Morrel , who had already gone some few steps away , again returned , and pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening . <EOS>	76.67990112304688
My place of abode is No . <EOS>	357.6978759765625
Franz had , as yet , found nothing to say ; he had come to no determination , and as nothing in the count ’ s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him , he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past , or wait until he had more proof ; besides , although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening , he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum . <EOS>	48.26776885986328
“ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ! ” cried the latter , like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep , “ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan ! ” “ Himself , Monsieur Bernouin. ” “ And why have you come here ? ” “ To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarin—the freshest news there is. ” “ What has become of him , then ? ” “ He is as well as you and I. ” “ Nothing bad has happened to him , then ? ” “ Absolutely nothing . <EOS>	29.203834533691406

“ So you were at the races , baron ? ” inquired the countess eagerly . <EOS>	28.282991409301758
Without doubt , Porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments , for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand , he pulled it toward him , so that D ’ Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos . <EOS>	87.60974884033203

And you say that by his will—— ” “ He leaves me five hundred thousand livres. ” “ Are you sure of it ? ” “ He showed it me ; but that is not all—there is a codicil , as I said just now. ” “ Probably. ” “ And in that codicil he acknowledges me. ” “ Oh , the good father , the brave father , the very honest father ! ” said Caderousse , twirling a plate in the air between his two hands . <EOS>	51.174652099609375
The young woman continued to advance ; and in addition to the lightness of her step , which had betrayed her , she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice . <EOS>	63.368553161621094
It was the king speaking on the scaffold . <EOS>	50.90323257446289
No doubt , now , we shall hear that our friend is released ! ” Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door . <EOS>	51.87685775756836
“ I would not lose this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me , which I am determined to conquer , whatever they may be , by my devotion. ” And without listening to Villefort he arose , and followed Valentine , who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to . <EOS>	104.79141235351562
Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs , and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment . <EOS>	107.1292953491211
“ What is the use of following the alleys ? <EOS>	39.773868560791016
“ I accept it , ” interposed D ’ Artagnan , proudly . <EOS>	13.616040229797363
The counter was covered with a plate of pewter ; upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin : “ Rueil ... D .. ” “ They went to Rueil , ” cried Aramis . <EOS>	102.2425537109375
However , I swear I was not guilty , I swear it by—— ” The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear , and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry , a small coffer of rosewood set in silver , and laying it on the altar : “ I swear , ” she said , “ by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my lover. ” “ What relics are those by which you swear ? ” asked Mazarin , smiling . <EOS>	82.22305297851562
Franz congratulated Albert , who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited . <EOS>	89.84015655517578
“ Well , _pardieu ! _ there is yours , my dear friend , ” replied D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	11.5741605758667
“ Oh , you are a man of God , sir , ” cried Caderousse ; “ for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond , and you might have kept it. ” “ Which , ” said the abbé to himself , “ you would have done. ” The abbé rose , took his hat and gloves . <EOS>	20.545743942260742

At ten o ’ clock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the king , and then a movement , similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops , ran though the multitude , which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard . <EOS>	100.0297622680664
“ You love my mistress , then , very dearly , Monsieur Chevalier ? ” said she . <EOS>	32.44905090332031

But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend , the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars , “ I must speak to you. ” “ When ? ” “ Tomorrow. ” “ Where ? ” “ In my office , or in the court , if you like , —that is the surest place. ” “ I will be there. ” At this moment Madame de Villefort approached . <EOS>	38.405914306640625

At the last hour we must confess this action and God knows better than we can whether it is a crime , a fault , or a meritorious deed . <EOS>	100.7958984375
Monsieur de Lillebonne , lead my horse by the bridle , if you please. ” As he spoke he dismounted , gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said , in a voice perfectly composed , “ To the Palais Royal , at full trot. ” The carriage drove on and D ’ Artagnan , availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing , threw himself into the arms of the prisoner . <EOS>	44.38486862182617
If my pardon be complete , we shall return triumphant to Yanina ; if the news be inauspicious , we must fly this night. ’ — ‘ But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so ? ’ said my mother . <EOS>	85.84527587890625
“ Ah ! ” he said , “ it is sad , I know well , to be forced to yield thus ; but , pshaw ! <EOS>	32.67632293701172
Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy , her native place . <EOS>	191.82513427734375
There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant , but that Porthos was not at Bracieux . <EOS>	138.0932159423828
No , my daughter is not guilty . <EOS>	37.30524444580078
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other , and grew pale . <EOS>	16.498266220092773
“ That I might the sooner see you again , my dear father , ” replied the young man . <EOS>	23.91008758544922
“ Athos ! ” exclaimed D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	4.924120903015137
He wished to subdue this woman in his own name ; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it , he could not make up his mind to renounce it . <EOS>	47.42258834838867
Sometimes their play degenerated into battles , and in these battles the king was not always the stronger . <EOS>	236.70892333984375
Seeing , however , no one there except a musketeer of his own troop , he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier , in whose dress , nevertheless , he recognized at the first glance the cardinal . <EOS>	125.7596435546875
We stepped into the boat . <EOS>	91.78113555908203
This morning you rose at five o ’ clock ; you must stand in need of repose . <EOS>	41.889129638671875
What the devil ! <EOS>	47.57314682006836
My daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son twenty-one . <EOS>	97.06884002685547
“ No , my child , no , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran ; “ but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival , that I might send for your father. ” “ My father ? ” inquired Valentine , uneasily . <EOS>	16.409671783447266
As little sensitive as was the heart of D ’ Artagnan , he was touched by this mute sorrow ; but he held too tenaciously to his projects , above all to this one , to change the program which he had laid out in advance . <EOS>	91.53843688964844
They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word . <EOS>	77.69844055175781

“ Well done , Guitant , ” cried the cardinal to the equestrian ; “ I see plainly that , notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed over your head , you are still the same man , active and zealous . <EOS>	61.590328216552734
And D ’ Artagnan had time , therefore , to watch Bazin unsuspected . <EOS>	74.71220397949219
Unquestionably , Edmond ’ s star is in the ascendant , and he will marry the splendid girl—he will be captain , too , and laugh at us all , unless ” —a sinister smile passed over Danglars ’ lips— “ unless I take a hand in the affair , ” he added . <EOS>	150.78598022460938
“ Well , ” said Morcerf , “ I may as well be magnanimous , and tear myself away to forward your wishes . <EOS>	55.93642044067383

The hour of the banquet being come , the two guards arrived , took their places , and the dishes were arranged on the table . <EOS>	45.892822265625
He would fain have gazed upon his gold , and yet he had not strength enough ; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him , and then rushed madly about the rocks of Monte Cristo , terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with his wild cries and gestures ; then he returned , and , still unable to believe the evidence of his senses , rushed into the grotto , and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels . <EOS>	83.93572235107422
Come , then , my friend , we will go forward. ” “ Haven ’ t you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account ? ” “ My friend , ” said Athos , “ I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary. ” “ And how long ago was that ? ” “ When I last drew my poniard. ” “ Ah ! <EOS>	33.94830322265625

Several persons are invited , and among others , M. Danglars , your banker . <EOS>	104.19698333740234
It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes , fingers placed upon the lips , little assassinating smiles , which really did assassinate the disdained beauty . <EOS>	250.98519897460938
It had not been used . <EOS>	39.423343658447266
He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures , that the count , like himself , had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart . <EOS>	83.70802307128906
“ Yes , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ from this very day ; and mind , if the wine is bad , we will send him to find better. ” “ We must use , and not abuse , ” said Aramis , sententiously . <EOS>	32.423561096191406
I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain ; I have punished him for his injustice , that is all. ” De Winter , stupefied , looked on while the soldiers bound Felton , and could not tell what to think of such insensibility . <EOS>	91.72950744628906
Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy , I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo ; now , ” he added , with a sigh , “ it is you who will conduct me thither . <EOS>	44.35749053955078
“ Yes , my lord. ” “ And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon , are we not to enjoy his society ? ” “ Certainly , my lord ; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais Royal. ” “ And we start in his carriage , then ? ” “ Yes , my lord. ” “ And with us no other escort but you two ? ” “ Is it not enough ? <EOS>	22.599090576171875
“ When I presented myself before you for the first time in London , it was to ask you what had become of my fortune ; the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name ; and this time I come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other , to say to you as God said to the first murderer : ‘ Cain , what hast thou done to thy brother Abel ? ’ My lord , what have you done with your sister—your sister , who was my mother ? ” De Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes . <EOS>	68.87962341308594
In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts , lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor . <EOS>	150.71849060058594
“ You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news ? ” “ Alas , sire , ” answered Athos , “ your majesty has guessed aright. ” “ It is bad news ? ” “ Yes , sire. ” “ Never mind ; the messenger is welcome . <EOS>	40.2645149230957
His hands , gracefully placed , one upon his hat , the other in the opening of his white waistcoat , were not at all tremulous ; his eye was calm and even brilliant . <EOS>	76.1637954711914
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de Villefort ; all I seek is happiness. ” Valentine imperceptibly thanked him , while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks . <EOS>	156.904052734375

At last , after renewed hesitation , Dantès entered the second grotto . <EOS>	82.60570526123047

“ There is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves. ” “ I do not accuse them , sire ; but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes. ” “ Yes , you are right , Tréville , you are right ! ” “ Then , upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds , and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred ; for your Majesty can not be ignorant that the Musketeers , who belong to the king and nobody but the king , are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen , who belong to the cardinal. ” “ Yes , Tréville , yes , ” said the king , in a melancholy tone ; “ and it is very sad , believe me , to see thus two parties in France , two heads to royalty . <EOS>	62.71055603027344
“ Because we want to know , ” said De Guiche , haughtily . <EOS>	22.672664642333984
Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tréville—a thing which , considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer , had very much astonished his captain . <EOS>	166.34725952148438
“ We never joke , ” replied Peppino , solemn as a Quaker . <EOS>	57.109474182128906
“ I must know what you mean to do ! ” said she . <EOS>	15.42410659790039
These horrible chills , which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones , begin to pervade my whole frame ; in five minutes the malady will reach its height , and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse. ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed Dantès , his heart wrung with anguish . <EOS>	120.33361053466797
The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun , was seen against the azure sky . <EOS>	76.87855529785156
“ Besides , ” continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking— “ besides , who says that it will begin again ? ” “ It has returned , count , ” exclaimed Morrel ; “ that is why I hastened to you. ” “ Well , what do you wish me to do ? <EOS>	33.05296325683594
But the Prince de Marsillac ! <EOS>	56.32131576538086
He was telling me this morning that , tired of letting his property lie dormant in Italy , which is a dead nation , he wished to find a method , either in France or England , of multiplying his millions , but remember , that though I place great confidence in Busoni , I am not responsible for this. ” “ Never mind ; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me . <EOS>	127.26863861083984
He could do it in an hour , and how many times had he , for pure pastime , continued in the water for more than twice as long ! <EOS>	114.25577545166016

Nay , it must have been a promise. ” “ A country clown , ” said Anne of Austria , “ people will laugh. ” “ Let them , ” answered D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	28.50994873046875
This is the fourth which you have let fall and I have picked up ; for in three years , madame , I have only seen you four times—the first , which I have described to you ; the second , at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse ; the third , in the gardens of Amiens. ” “ Duke , ” said the queen , blushing , “ never speak of that evening. ” “ Oh , let us speak of it ; on the contrary , let us speak of it ! <EOS>	32.04689407348633
I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired , but he is fascinated with his Luccanese . <EOS>	62.75665283203125
D ’ Artagnan , I am your prisoner—treat me as such. ” “ Ah ! <EOS>	35.90935134887695
“ Have you tied the knot ? ” inquired the first speaker . <EOS>	33.255271911621094
As to the king , he made no demonstration of politeness , only stopping before the queen . <EOS>	44.02539825439453
“ The explanation would be too long , my dear landlord , ” replied Franz . <EOS>	29.37589454650879
“ It is impossible , ” said the procureur . <EOS>	6.526801109313965
He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted . <EOS>	81.28214263916016
But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it , and that is my object beyond all others. ” M. de Tréville was surprised to the greatest degree . <EOS>	71.8276596069336
They both advanced beneath the trees , through whose branches streamed the moonlight . <EOS>	128.7489471435547
My brother Edward , who inherits nothing from his mother , will , therefore , be poor in comparison with me . <EOS>	77.48451232910156

_Imponite manus_ , and not _manum_—place the _hands_ , not the _hand_. ” “ Place the _hands_ , ” repeated the curate , with a gesture . <EOS>	91.17182159423828
“ First , my lord ? ” inquired Grimaud . <EOS>	22.077388763427734
Have no more concern about me ; I exist no longer for you , any more than if you had never seen me. ” “ Must Aramis do as much as I , madame ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , deeply piqued . <EOS>	57.24137496948242
I may be besieged in my turn , and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master. ” “ Lord , monsieur ! <EOS>	35.12153625488281
“ Proceed ! ” said he to the host . <EOS>	9.939942359924316
The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind . <EOS>	83.35738372802734
Ah , Maximilian , I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend. ” “ Your logic is most powerful , Valentine , but say what you will , I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind . <EOS>	97.9242935180664
“ Put it up again , my friend , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	10.573524475097656
But to you , at least , M. Debray , I need not give a further description , because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known . <EOS>	99.15960693359375
I say _there_ , for as I did not consider my house safe enough , or lawyers sufficiently discreet , and as landed property carries evidence with it , and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband , I have kept this sum , now your whole fortune , in a chest concealed under that closet , and for greater security I myself concealed it there . <EOS>	197.26515197753906
A horse for Planchet , that ’ s all . <EOS>	39.49717712402344
He returned to Mousqueton , but the steward had sold the last wisp . <EOS>	83.61865997314453
Thus , for instance , don ’ t you in the first place want a horse ? ” “ Yes , a horse. ” “ Well , then ! <EOS>	24.59290313720703
A youthful indiscretion , I suppose , which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large ? ” The major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to compose his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an under-look at the count , the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity . <EOS>	94.2831802368164
They listened ; he went into his sleeping-room , and fastened the door inside . <EOS>	57.94285583496094
“ Am I to say what you told me ? ” asked Valentine . <EOS>	18.218542098999023
if you would but accept my offers ! <EOS>	138.0640411376953
Athos , who was very expert in all bodily exercises , passed with D ’ Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them ; but at the first effort he made , although he played with his left hand , he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion . <EOS>	60.35262680053711
“ I pardon you , ” said he , “ for the poisoning of my brother , and the assassination of his Grace , Lord Buckingham . <EOS>	29.252948760986328

She tried to replace the arm , but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse . <EOS>	103.97745513916016
Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him , but the man refused . <EOS>	62.99863815307617
I embrace you with all my heart . <EOS>	29.605268478393555
The queen entered . <EOS>	18.54231071472168
He entered by the Faubourg St. Jacques , under verdant arches . <EOS>	86.61297607421875
What has happened is quite natural , and in conformity with the law of reprisals. ’ “ ‘ What , ’ cried I , ‘ do you , a magistrate , speak thus to me ? ’ “ ‘ All these Corsicans are mad , on my honor , ’ replied M. de Villefort ; ‘ they fancy that their countryman is still emperor . <EOS>	51.17577362060547
“ Yes , for the mother ’ s sake—his poor mother ! ” cried the major , taking a third biscuit . <EOS>	44.334136962890625
From the top of an eminence D ’ Artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat , in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint Maur . <EOS>	64.33614349365234
A young priest , with a simple and trustful heart , performed the duties of the church of that convent . <EOS>	87.01791381835938
The cries died away in groans , and next morning , as soon as Wasilio ’ s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad , she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities , when Assunta , although dreadfully burnt , was found still breathing ; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open , and the money stolen . <EOS>	187.6392822265625
However , he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night . <EOS>	59.55681610107422
Just as , ordinarily , faces are colored by blood , his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid . <EOS>	306.60162353515625
I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence , as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended . <EOS>	48.74381637573242
It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle ; he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back , and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door . <EOS>	102.12677764892578
The Parisians , always curious , always affected by funereal display , looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy—the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles . <EOS>	226.1884765625

The review over , the Guards set forward alone on their march , the Musketeers waiting for the king , which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours . <EOS>	94.22196960449219
I will make you all captains , with good pensions ! <EOS>	70.319580078125
“ But on our return , ” he said aloud , “ may we , that is , my friend and I , depend on having , he his barony , and I my promotion ? ” “ On the honor of Mazarin. ” “ I should like another sort of oath better , ” said D ’ Artagnan to himself ; then aloud , “ May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen ? ” “ Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly , ” replied Mazarin ; “ go , pray , sir—— ” “ One word more , my lord ; if there ’ s any fighting where I ’ m going , must I fight ? ” “ You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed the inclosed letter. ” “ ’ Tis well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , holding out his hand to receive the money . <EOS>	51.258209228515625

Are you a doctor ? ” “ Yes ; the best you could have at the present time , believe me. ” “ But you say you have watched ? ” said Valentine uneasily ; “ where have you been ? —I have not seen you. ” The count extended his hand towards the library . <EOS>	32.76333236694336
I kept the third for myself , and I had it hollowed out , which reduced its value , but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I intended. ” Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment ; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth , or that he was mad . <EOS>	78.62516021728516
He advanced slowly toward Milady , who had seated herself , and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect , or perhaps by design , she allowed to be seen , “ What is this , madame ? ” he asked coldly . <EOS>	71.91748046875
As I before said , I thought the whole thing was a joke , nothing more . <EOS>	55.35554122924805
I do not know whether I love you or love you not ; but what I know is that I will not be perjured . <EOS>	38.25452423095703
At all events , she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother-in-law , with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily , rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy . <EOS>	66.7852554321289
“ Poor fellow ! ” he exclaimed . <EOS>	10.309088706970215
“ Ah , what else is there ? ” said Danglars ; “ for , at present , I can not say that I have seen anything extraordinary . <EOS>	22.462326049804688
Farewell. ” He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head . <EOS>	54.27452850341797
And now let us see , young man , with your hand upon your conscience , how did all this come to pass ? ” D ’ Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details ; how , not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his Majesty , he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience ; how they had gone together to the tennis court , and how , upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face , he had been jeered at by Bernajoux , who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life , and M. de la Trémouille , who had nothing to do with the matter , with the loss of his hôtel . <EOS>	65.7685317993164
From whom comes this letter ? ” “ From her Majesty , as I think. ” “ From her Majesty ! ” said Buckingham , becoming so pale that D ’ Artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal . <EOS>	47.45334243774414
I stepped into the shed , and it was fortunate I did so , for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger . <EOS>	57.46220397949219
As to Bazin , he went and lay down on a truss of straw ; and as he had more imagination than the Swiss , he dreamed that Aramis , having become pope , adorned his head with a cardinal ’ s hat . <EOS>	52.73480987548828
As a proof , remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me , and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night. ” That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme . <EOS>	65.96753692626953
I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment. ” “ You are , then , a chemist ? ” “ Somewhat ; I know Lavoisier , and was the intimate friend of Cabanis. ” “ But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any ? ” “ I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome ; but after reading them over many times , I found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses , if not a complete summary of all human knowledge , at least all that a man need really know . <EOS>	146.329833984375
The little house was surrounded by a low , quickset hedge , two or three feet high . <EOS>	105.15892028808594
The king , as we have said , was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice had been held ; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the twenty-eighth of June , he felt himself attacked by fever . <EOS>	79.62171936035156
Coquenard understood it . <EOS>	146.59564208984375
“ I made the tour of the room at least twenty times , in search of an outlet of some kind ; but there was none . <EOS>	55.61105728149414
The Duc de Chatillon commanded the centre . <EOS>	48.47675704956055
and Madame de Villefort , ” cried Baptistin . <EOS>	18.747426986694336
One was perfectly charming , delicate , pensive , shaded by beautiful dark hair , and eyes soft as velvet , like those lovely flowers , the heartsease , in which shine out the golden petals . <EOS>	152.80198669433594
As for myself , that I may put you at your ease , I tell you that I am generally called ‘ Sinbad the Sailor. ’ ” “ And I , ” replied Franz , “ will tell you , as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin , that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin . <EOS>	40.6463508605957
( “ Porthos , ” murmured D ’ Artagnan , “ look well at that priest. ” “ Yes , ” said Porthos , “ I see him . <EOS>	13.947541236877441
Porthos bowed , as if in assent . <EOS>	65.39480590820312
I am not so much at liberty as you suppose ; on the contrary , I have a most important engagement. ” “ Ah , take care , you were teaching me just now how , in case of an invitation to dinner , one might creditably make an excuse . <EOS>	61.6016960144043
I tried to open the door , but it was locked inside ; then I called the sergeant. ” “ And here I am , ” said the sergeant . <EOS>	31.36105728149414
“ Sir , ” resumed Villefort , “ we are thinking of marrying Valentine. ” Had the old man ’ s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there . <EOS>	74.92440795898438
The Guardsmen , imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack , either of the besieged or the English , sprang to their swords . <EOS>	106.41372680664062
Franz continued : “ ‘ The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly , but M. de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him . <EOS>	73.82691955566406
Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen you at my house ? ” “ Ah , true. ” “ Fix it this way . <EOS>	38.18975830078125
“ A weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design . <EOS>	165.79611206054688
“ What was the matter with you , baron ? ” D ’ Artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the Palais Royal . <EOS>	16.21013832092285
It is something to be well received . <EOS>	29.196836471557617

“ He has broken his ribs , ” said the commander , in a low voice . <EOS>	20.105770111083984
If I bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of England. ” “ What is your name , then ? ” asked Mazarin . <EOS>	24.834428787231445
“ What , is it you , Edmond , back again ? ” said he , with a broad Marseillaise accent , and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth . <EOS>	66.12364959716797
He was compelled , then , after having swallowed the contents of his bottle , to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion , to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep , whether well or ill. D ’ Artagnan , be it remembered , was only twenty years old , and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon , even with the saddest hearts . <EOS>	126.00431060791016
That gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life. ” “ Who are those gentlemen ? ” asked Danglars of Monte Cristo . <EOS>	34.40366744995117
“ Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he will sleep better to-morrow night. ” These blunt words , so terrible if taken literally , were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter . <EOS>	173.2703094482422
I was deceived , as it appears , and I ask your pardon. ” “ And what did Monsieur d ’ Artagnan reply ? ” “ Monsieur d ’ Artagnan promised me his assistance ; but I soon found out that he was betraying me. ” “ You impose upon justice . <EOS>	27.281578063964844
The couple , then , although they had not seen each other for eight days , and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned , accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation . <EOS>	58.06510925292969
As he spoke , and in the very direction he indicated , a groan , expressive of bitter grief , was heard , and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail . <EOS>	103.97537231445312
But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years ; what he did during these ten years , God only knows . <EOS>	90.22099304199219
By the light of one of these torches D ’ Artagnan perceived men in uniform . <EOS>	91.63687133789062

The dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself , with the deepest respect , at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny , who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud , but a frown succeeded , and he bit his lips with vexation . <EOS>	125.923583984375

The boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys , bearing the guilty woman and the executioner ; all the others remained on the right-hand bank , where they fell on their knees . <EOS>	70.88111114501953
You have an excellent memory , Milady. ” “ But , ” resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment , “ if , in spite of all these reasons , the duke does not give way and continues to menace France ? ” “ The duke is in love to madness , or rather to folly , ” replied Richelieu , with great bitterness . <EOS>	60.79521179199219
D ’ Artagnan had run , sword in hand , through all the neighboring streets , but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for . <EOS>	75.03663635253906
The two grooms held the horses , that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled , and Grimaud was posted as sentinel . <EOS>	66.46147155761719
“ I really don ’ t know what hotel it is ; all I do know is that I observed some suspicious looking people go in there—— ” “ Nonsense ! ” exclaimed Guitant , with a burst of laughter ; “ those men must be poets. ” “ Come , Guitant , speak , if you please , respectfully of these gentlemen , ” said Mazarin ; “ don ’ t you know that I was in my youth a poet ? <EOS>	46.77352523803711
“ To the Palais Royal , ” he called out . <EOS>	21.065332412719727
“ To Cours la Reine ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan to the coachman ; then turning to Mazarin he said , “ Now , my lord , you can say five paters and five aves , in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance . <EOS>	47.436702728271484

Locusta and Agrippina , living at the same time , were an exception , and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of the Roman empire , sullied by so many crimes . <EOS>	133.15753173828125

Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine , which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week , and which preoccupied him a good deal . <EOS>	115.80230712890625
He shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future . <EOS>	188.8486328125
The stranger was about to reply ; but at the moment he opened his mouth , D ’ Artagnan , who had heard all , precipitated himself over the threshold of the door . <EOS>	20.6502685546875
As for that Benedetto , who so grossly belied his name , have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone , or what has become of him ? ” “ No ; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself , I should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast . <EOS>	130.21214294433594

At the same moment a fearful “ hurrah ! ” rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads . <EOS>	165.61666870117188

As to the wounded man , he had been taken in at once , and , as we have said , in a very bad state . <EOS>	20.428560256958008
He then left for Madrid , and was no more heard of . <EOS>	98.6155014038086

These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long ; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing , so legible that Dantès could easily read it , as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian , a language he , as a Provençal , perfectly understood . <EOS>	211.87088012695312
As nine o ’ clock sounded , D ’ Artagnan was at the Place Royale . <EOS>	15.139570236206055
The boat was moored to the shore , and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac ; but , doubtless , the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel , for he cried out : “ Not that way , if you please. ” Gaetano faltered an excuse , and advanced to the opposite side , while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way . <EOS>	95.71533203125
Aided by the remaining fragment , I guessed the rest ; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper , and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed , as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us. ” “ And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion ? ” “ I resolved to set out , and did set out at that very instant , carrying with me the beginning of my great work , the unity of the Italian kingdom ; but for some time the imperial police ( who at this period , quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him , wished for a partition of provinces ) had their eyes on me ; and my hasty departure , the cause of which they were unable to guess , having aroused their suspicions , I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino . <EOS>	138.70001220703125
When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all , friends and foes ; and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell. ” “ You have some plan , then ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	104.01628112792969
The gate opened , a carriage rolled down the avenue , and stopped at the steps . <EOS>	29.841093063354492
“ Monsieur Morrel , ” said Valentine to the young man , who was regarding her with the most intense interest , “ my grandfather , M. Noirtier , had a thousand things to say , which he told me three days ago ; and now , he has sent for you , that I may repeat them to you . <EOS>	26.180131912231445

“ In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed , and his clothes were thrown into a corner , where the police picked them up , with the exception of the waistcoat , which they overlooked. ” Andrea turned pale , and drew towards the door ; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon , which appeared to forebode a coming storm . <EOS>	62.550479888916016

“ Yes , sire , ” interrupted Aramis , raising his voice , “ Bishop Juxon , the faithful knight of Christ , obedient to your majesty ’ s wishes. ” Charles clasped his hands , amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners , without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them , thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king . <EOS>	79.5394515991211

“ Bless me ! ” cried Porthos , making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of D ’ Artagnan , who was wriggling about his back ; “ you must be mad to run against people in this manner. ” “ Excuse me , ” said D ’ Artagnan , reappearing under the shoulder of the giant , “ but I am in such haste—I was running after someone and— ” “ And do you always forget your eyes when you run ? ” asked Porthos . <EOS>	48.145137786865234

“ And now , ” resumed Bertuccio , “ your excellency may , perhaps , be able to comprehend that this place , which I revisit for the first time—this garden , the actual scene of my crime—must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature , and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency , who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause . <EOS>	79.31652069091797
But Mercédès did not witness his departure , although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantès . <EOS>	46.70050811767578
The soldier replied that he was , and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him . <EOS>	25.83485984802246
If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croesus. ” Then aloud : “ Are you ambitious ? ” “ As Enceladus. ” “ Well , my friend , I bring you the means of becoming rich , powerful , and free to do whatever you wish. ” The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramis ’ s face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain ; but quick as it was , it did not escape D ’ Artagnan ’ s observation . <EOS>	58.84729766845703
At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo ; he eagerly advanced , and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses , saw that there , in all probability , the opening must be . <EOS>	102.9803466796875
But , as you know , a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance , so his carriage , fast as it went , was never above half a day ’ s journey before me , who followed him on foot . <EOS>	114.62722778320312
stop an instant , the name seems certainly familiar . <EOS>	291.5783386230469

“ He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting-maid—poor Kitty ! <EOS>	145.23692321777344
I had but to write to the Duchesse—but I won ’ t repeat her name , for I am incapable of compromising a woman ; but this I know , that I had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred. ” The procurator ’ s wife shed a tear . <EOS>	42.75794982910156
Let me hasten to add , ” continued he , “ that the testator , having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune , and having alienated it all , the will will not bear scrutiny , and is declared null and void. ” “ Yes. ” said Villefort ; “ but I warn M. d ’ Épinay , that during my life-time my father ’ s will shall never be questioned , my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained. ” 40032m “ Sir , ” said Franz , “ I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine ; I have never inquired the amount of her fortune , which , however limited it may be , exceeds mine . <EOS>	64.56729125976562
During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape . <EOS>	50.66767883300781
For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs , while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven . <EOS>	131.03968811035156

“ Remain here , fasten the door inside , and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this ; ” and he tapped thrice—two taps close together and pretty hard , the other after an interval , and lighter . <EOS>	223.43638610839844
It was therefore near seven o ’ clock ; but Edmond ’ s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head . <EOS>	60.54583740234375
“ You will go to London , ” continued the cardinal . <EOS>	12.076167106628418
An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through . <EOS>	332.12786865234375
The patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo , which being completely deserted , and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers , seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury , the god of merchants and robbers , classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct , but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category . <EOS>	140.74342346191406
Let us drink ! ” “ But then , philosopher that you are , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ instruct me , support me . <EOS>	22.230632781982422
Besides , you can tell them that you have full confidence in me , and they will not be more incredulous than you. ” “ I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days , that is all—to Athos , whose wound still makes him suffer , to go to the waters of Forges ; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend , whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition . <EOS>	55.868125915527344

“ And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green ? ” “ Oh , that coat is not his own idea ; it is the Republic ’ s , which deputed David12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians. ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ so this gentleman is an Academician ? ” “ Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly. ” “ And what is his especial talent ? ” “ His talent ? <EOS>	63.92116165161133
At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe , worked with gold , in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls . <EOS>	76.03497314453125
Several times Lord de Winter , Porthos , or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak ; but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed , without response . <EOS>	101.32284545898438
The ‘ Baroness Porthos ’ will sound particularly charming. ” And the two friends began to laugh . <EOS>	167.82870483398438
They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos , which always indicated an event of some gravity . <EOS>	106.65390014648438
But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light—that is to say , with all its advantages ; when he had pointed out to her , in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris , the viceroyalty of Font-de-l ’ Arche , in other words , of all Normandy ; when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal ; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font , Madame de Longueville contended no longer , except as is the custom with pretty women to contend , and defended herself only to surrender at last . <EOS>	122.63824462890625

“ And when can I see this young lady , for whom I already feel so great a sympathy ? ” asked Milady . <EOS>	40.80184555053711
I requested him to call , and when I came to the Louvre I left orders if he came , to desire him to wait. ” “ Let him be sent for instantly. ” “ Your Majesty ’ s orders shall be executed ; but— ” “ But what ? ” “ But the queen will perhaps refuse to obey. ” “ My orders ? ” “ Yes , if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king. ” “ Well , that she may have no doubt on that head , I will go and inform her myself. ” “ Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture. ” “ Yes , Duke , yes , I know you are very indulgent toward the queen , too indulgent , perhaps ; we shall have occasion , I warn you , at some future period to speak of that. ” “ Whenever it shall please your Majesty ; but I shall be always happy and proud , sire , to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see reign between you and the Queen of France. ” “ Very well , Cardinal , very well ; but , meantime , send for Monsieur the Keeper of the Seals . <EOS>	55.46344757080078

And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond , which she thinks you know. ” And so saying , Mazarin extended his hand to the officer , who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased from Monsieur des Essarts . <EOS>	59.47111129760742
To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentine ’ s confidence and knew all their secrets , Morrel took the dictionary , a pen , and some paper , and placed them all on a table where there was a light . <EOS>	58.533912658691406
A strange , incomprehensible , unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city ; one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets , now dark as ocean ’ s most unfathomable caves . <EOS>	232.7921905517578

Monte Cristo seemed in despair . <EOS>	43.497249603271484
D ’ Artagnan and Athos took the nags of Planchet and Grimaud , and the two lackeys started on foot , carrying the saddles on their heads . <EOS>	34.92649841308594
I have more than once intended witnessing an execution , but I have never been able to make up my mind ; and you , Albert ? ” “ I , ” replied the viscount , — “ I saw Castaing executed , but I think I was rather intoxicated that day , for I had quitted college the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern. ” “ Besides , it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris , that you should not see one anywhere else ; when you travel , it is to see everything . <EOS>	48.608299255371094
Bonacieux ; “ let us fly ! <EOS>	54.62460708618164
“ Well , then , ” said the host , “ your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago ; he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambrin. ” “ How far is Mazingarbe ? ” “ Two miles and a half. ” “ Thank you. ” Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time , when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man . <EOS>	60.25782012939453
“ Hell has made you rich , hell has given you another name , hell has almost made you another face ; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body. ” Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring , and her eyes flashed lightning . <EOS>	163.86968994140625
Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so . <EOS>	31.897830963134766
The faint glimpses of the pale moon , hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky , whitened the gravel walks that led to the house , but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies , in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery . <EOS>	138.4656219482422

Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death ? ” “ It is I who no longer understand you , madame , ” said Felton . <EOS>	36.878662109375
Name to me such of your workmen as you need , and point out the tools they must bring. ” The goldsmith knew the duke . <EOS>	189.2242431640625
The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu ; then they gained the private staircase and D ’ Artagnan was ushered into the oratory . <EOS>	76.29589080810547
Grimaud , thinking that they had come , as he had , to try the port wine , effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one . <EOS>	63.26047134399414
There was nothing particular about it , excepting that , although daylight had disappeared , it was not lighted , and everything in it was old-fashioned , while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated . <EOS>	68.32511901855469

He cast himself on his knees , seized the hand , and touched it respectfully with his lips . <EOS>	29.600631713867188
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening , and had gone to bed and to sleep . <EOS>	39.55613327026367
“ Nothing , ” replied Maximilian . <EOS>	12.563868522644043
I suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket ? ” “ Yes , madame ; I have that of the Garter , which King Charles I. gave me some days before he died. ” “ Come , I am growing an old woman ! ” said the duchess , pensively . <EOS>	35.10932922363281
Everything was conducted in the usual manner . <EOS>	104.15028381347656
I thought they might be useful , so I took them. ” Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols . <EOS>	60.87919616699219
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive . <EOS>	159.794677734375
And remember , moreover , that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife , absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world . <EOS>	67.07759857177734
Imagine my surprise , when , upon returning home , the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket ! <EOS>	253.9994354248047
“ A magnificent cavalier , ” remarked Mazarin . <EOS>	32.47943878173828
“ And then , ” resumed D ’ Artagnan , “ to this decrepitude is probably added poverty , for he must have neglected the little that he had , and the dirty scoundrel , Grimaud , more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master—stay , Planchet , it breaks my heart to merely think of it. ” “ I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him stammering , ” said Planchet , in a piteous tone , “ but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things , for I imagine that those lofty walls , now turning ruby in the setting sun , are the walls of Blois. ” “ Probably ; and those steeples , pointed and sculptured , that we catch a glimpse of yonder , are similar to those that I have heard described at Chambord. ” At this moment one of those heavy wagons , drawn by bullocks , which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the Loire , came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following . <EOS>	103.86541748046875
Albert took Beauchamp aside , and communicated these ideas to him . <EOS>	118.42756652832031
Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to them . <EOS>	85.3154296875
Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women . <EOS>	70.79740905761719
To this preoccupation of his vanity , D ’ Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish . <EOS>	121.44058227539062
At length they arrived at the cemetery . <EOS>	18.976688385009766
“ Just so , ” muttered Comminges , looking after Mazarin . <EOS>	43.151241302490234
But , perhaps , you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses ? ” “ My dear love , pray do not say any more about them , and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance , only more quiet and steady. ” The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt , while her husband , affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture , turned towards Monte Cristo and said , — “ Upon my word , count , I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner . <EOS>	63.793121337890625
But Peppino , instead of answering , threw himself on his knees , seized the count ’ s hand , and covered it with kisses . <EOS>	30.162675857543945
Then a strange reaction took place ; he who had just abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left , and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation—he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness . <EOS>	199.01748657226562
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer , but to have everything he wanted . <EOS>	62.448707580566406
adieu ! ” And raising himself by a final effort , in which he summoned all his faculties , he said , — “ Monte Cristo , forget not Monte Cristo ! ” And he fell back on the bed . <EOS>	37.82957458496094
He was a man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old , but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises . <EOS>	114.65888214111328
“ Perhaps so . <EOS>	38.68888473510742
Remain here ? <EOS>	1071.594970703125
“ And I , too , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	5.617721080780029
Bonacieux , mechanically , “ yes , let us be gone. ” Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite , poured her a small glass of Spanish wine , and helped her to the wing of a chicken . <EOS>	56.36841583251953
Danglars , however , who now made his appearance , accompanied by Caderousse , effectually confirmed the report , stating that he had recently conversed with M. Morrel , who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Réserve . <EOS>	77.1702880859375
Valentine entered at this moment , and the formalities were resumed . <EOS>	48.195762634277344
The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left ; it was entirely of marble , with antique bas-reliefs of priceless value ; and at the four corners of this apartment , which was oblong , were four magnificent statues , having baskets in their hands . <EOS>	127.62390899658203
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak , and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say , and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken . <EOS>	56.563812255859375
It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex , ” interrupted Valentine . <EOS>	149.63853454589844
“ Poor fellow , poor fellow ! ” murmured Caderousse . <EOS>	19.373027801513672
Having been several times up and down it , he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again . <EOS>	102.64873504638672
The count stopped on seeing the young man . <EOS>	24.24128532409668
“ Stay , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door. ” When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw D ’ Artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there , with their arms . <EOS>	38.25932312011719
“ I can imagine the effect , I do not see the means. ” “ I will find the means myself. ” “ You are aware it will be war , civil war , furious , devouring , implacable ? ” “ Oh ! <EOS>	58.88785934448242
“ Order out the carriage , ” he said , “ and remove the pistols which are in the holsters . <EOS>	27.302087783813477
“ All this is very extraordinary , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ still , what I admire the most , I confess , is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed . <EOS>	62.631988525390625
I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo , while the father talks to you. ” “ If you compliment her at all , let it be on her voice , at least , ” said Monte Cristo . <EOS>	54.74272918701172
“ Yes , frankly and loyally , ” replied the cardinal , in the same tone . <EOS>	17.299304962158203
Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion ; he arose , rushed out of the room and to the stairs , exclaiming energetically , “ Julie , Julie—Emmanuel , Emmanuel ! ” Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave , but Maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door , which he closed upon the count . <EOS>	102.0322036743164

“ The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill—— ” “ Milady ? ” “ Yes , Milady ; it is true you called her thus. ” “ What has the monk to do with this Milady ? ” “ She was his mother. ” Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner . <EOS>	40.76683044433594
I have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public , you say , is that they proceed from me , an unhappy foreigner , who has been unable to please the French . <EOS>	63.641998291015625
“ Alone ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	11.717586517333984
“ Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls , ” said the duke . <EOS>	34.859718322753906
My spirit is willing , my head is clear , but this demon , the gout , o ’ ercrows me . <EOS>	151.71266174316406
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon D ’ Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother . <EOS>	110.73737335205078
“ How pale he is ! ” said Château-Renaud , shuddering . <EOS>	29.42490577697754
Sit down , my dear friend , and let us talk. ” And Aramis pushed forward a large easy-chair , in which D ’ Artagnan stretched himself out . <EOS>	34.49551773071289
But all this will come to an end , Tréville , will come to an end . <EOS>	57.687740325927734
But then he may have stopped at Saint Germain. ” “ I don ’ t think so ; we appointed to meet at La Chevrette. ” “ I was there this very day. ” “ And had the pretty Madeleine no news ? ” asked Aramis , smiling . <EOS>	38.673667907714844
I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs . <EOS>	195.84494018554688
You have saved my life , and I thank you , ” continued Dantès . <EOS>	16.97283363342285
No ! <EOS>	71.7977294921875
Now , it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects , with their long black claws , for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals , factions , and government intrigues . <EOS>	242.04296875
The sight of this , instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon , filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment , and tears fell from his eyes . <EOS>	57.43505859375
Villefort sprang into the room , ran to Valentine , and took her in his arms . <EOS>	26.66860580444336
“ He first kills M. de Saint-Méran , ” repeated the doctor , “ then Madame de Saint-Méran , —a double fortune to inherit. ” Villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead . <EOS>	58.870704650878906
You see he has a truly royal escort. ” “ Ay , there ’ s no fear in the daytime ; but at night ? ” “ We redouble our precautions. ” “ And what method of surveillance do you employ ? ” “ Eight men remain constantly in his room. ” “ The deuce , he is well guarded , then . <EOS>	73.0221939086914
“ I love you ; you permit me to tell you that I do—that is already more happiness than I dared to hope. ” “ Silence ! ” said Mme . <EOS>	25.83551788330078
“ In the time of the cardinal people fired better than that , do you remember the road to Crevecoeur , Mousqueton ? ” “ Ah , sir ! <EOS>	51.805294036865234
“ Is this the man ? ” asked the captain , who was attentively reading Plutarch ’ s _Life of Alexander_ . <EOS>	72.45883178710938
You do not believe me , M. Danglars ! ” “ I can not help doubting , ” answered Danglars with his stupid smile . <EOS>	35.777523040771484
“ I will not detain you , monsieur , ” continued the countess ; “ I would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate. ” “ My dear Count , ” said Albert , “ I will endeavor to return your politeness at Rome , and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready. ” “ A thousand thanks for your kindness , viscount , ” returned the Count of Monte Cristo “ but I suppose that M.

Danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then , and gradually the man appeared less ugly , the bread less black , and the cheese more fresh , while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes , which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said , “ Monsieur Deniseau , let me have a nice little fricassee today. ” He got up and knocked on the door ; the bandit raised his head . <EOS>	162.65625
Three hours later , the man returned covered with dust , his errand was performed , and two minutes after , another man on foot , muffled in a mantle , opened the little door of the garden , which he closed after him . <EOS>	70.34426879882812
de Bernet were exiled , and Laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant . <EOS>	103.40213775634766
“ And now , sir , ” resumed Mousqueton , when he had rid himself of Planchet , who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend ’ s fat back , “ now , sir , allow me to leave you , for I could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself ; he would never forgive me for not having preceded you. ” “ This dear friend , ” said D ’ Artagnan , carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by Porthos or his new one , “ then he has not forgotten me ? ” “ Forgotten—he ! ” cried Mousqueton ; “ there ’ s not a day , sir , that we don ’ t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of Monsieur de Gassion , or of Monsieur de Bassompierre. ” On D ’ Artagnan ’ s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul—the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life ’ s disillusions . <EOS>	72.87539672851562
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life . <EOS>	132.4580841064453
Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart . <EOS>	180.77793884277344
I made no resistance ; I was no longer master of my senses . <EOS>	40.84661865234375
Bonacieux could not close his eyes ; not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable , but because his uneasiness was so great . <EOS>	68.90951538085938
However , he continued all the same , but with increasing warmth : “ Yes , I can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise ; but know beforehand , if you kill me or cause me to be killed , my precautions are taken . <EOS>	74.33548736572266
At three paces from her , seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs , leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table , was a tall young man of twenty , or two-and-twenty , who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled . <EOS>	83.3598861694336
And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo Rospoli , by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme , I don ’ t know but what I should have held on by my original plan . <EOS>	78.20320129394531
On these days he spoke a little . <EOS>	52.456703186035156

The young man was thrown from the top of the rock ; the corpse was found on the bed next day , and the whole truth was guessed , for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before , that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep , they heard a shriek , which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared. ” The count breathed with difficulty ; the cold drops ran down his forehead , and his heart was full of anguish . <EOS>	60.65153884887695
“ He ’ s heavy , though , for an old and thin man , ” said one , as he raised the head . <EOS>	44.579288482666016
In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard , the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams . <EOS>	97.8675765991211

And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards ; that is to say , soldiers . <EOS>	118.3946533203125

Now , as I dislike him , and hope his railway , his electric telegraph , or his search for baths , will ruin him , I am watching for his discomfiture , which must soon take place. ” “ What was the cause of your quarrel ? ” “ When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends. ” “ Why do you not seek revenge ? ” “ I have already fought three duels with him , ” said the Englishman , “ the first with the pistol , the second with the sword , and the third with the sabre. ” “ And what was the result of those duels ? ” “ The first time , he broke my arm ; the second , he wounded me in the breast ; and the third time , made this large wound. ” The Englishman turned down his shirt-collar , and showed a scar , whose redness proved it to be a recent one . <EOS>	67.95264434814453
The boat that now arrived , assured by the answering signal that all was well , soon came in sight , white and silent as a phantom , and cast anchor within a cable ’ s length of shore . <EOS>	140.80685424804688
“ No , ” said Villefort ; “ only return again at eleven o ’ clock ; at twelve the—the—oh , Heavens , my poor , poor child ! ” and the procureur again becoming a man , lifted up his eyes and groaned . <EOS>	41.62220001220703
The slightest rustling of the foliage , the least whistling of the wind , attracted his attention , and drew the perspiration to his brow ; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder , and , not to lose a moment , placed his foot on the first step . <EOS>	50.14934539794922
“ I have one thing to reproach myself with , ” said he , stopping Albert on the steps . <EOS>	29.764488220214844

“ There wasn ’ t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d ’ Enghien. ” “ Well , ” said the marquise , “ it seems probable that , by the aid of the Holy Alliance , we shall be rid of Napoleon ; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans . <EOS>	60.44366455078125

Morrel attributed Penelon ’ s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire ; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account ; he was , no doubt , engaged on board some other vessel , and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having , if we may so express ourselves , worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer . <EOS>	156.9169921875
A fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle . <EOS>	198.83326721191406
Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen ; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Tréville , who , as we have said , were that evening on guard . <EOS>	29.838111877441406
I will , in the meantime , go and prepare the young man for this much-desired interview , for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself. ” “ I should quite imagine that to be the case , ” said Cavalcanti . <EOS>	45.19296646118164
Besides , this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner . <EOS>	115.78568267822266

I suppose , had he found another additional vertebra , they would have made him a commander. ” “ Very likely , ” said Albert . <EOS>	48.93611145019531

Let us go to breakfast. ” “ I shall be happy to do so ; the morning air has made me hungry. ” “ Yes , ” said Porthos ; “ my air is excellent. ” They went into the chateau ; there was nothing but gilding , high and low ; the cornices were gilt , the mouldings were gilt , the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt . <EOS>	60.45998001098633
He threw some dust over the topcoat , which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume , and going to Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place . <EOS>	130.06692504882812
Morrel threw a glance around , but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer , still unperceived . <EOS>	97.05805206298828
“ Come here , Grimaud , ” said Athos . <EOS>	9.474708557128906
He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever , to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial . <EOS>	88.19593048095703

The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation ; for , after having gained a victory over the Spaniard , it had just gained another over the people . <EOS>	71.99615478515625
They entered . <EOS>	52.972129821777344
But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament , since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him . <EOS>	215.10989379882812
It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort ’ s look , —that look peculiar to the magistrate , who , while seeming to read the thoughts of others , betrays nothing of his own . <EOS>	63.188899993896484
A cloud passed over his brow as he said : “ No , monsieur , I do not know the writing , and yet it is tolerably plain . <EOS>	25.757457733154297
M. de Tréville had spoken of her to the queen . <EOS>	16.95375633239746
“ No , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ God grant I may not have done too much already. ” The next day they indeed left , accompanied only by Baptistin . <EOS>	40.470176696777344
“ Before God and before men , ” said he , “ I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham. ” “ The Duke of Buckingham assassinated ! ” cried all present , with one voice . <EOS>	36.372257232666016
“ How did these letters come ? ” said he . <EOS>	15.716429710388184
“ No ; and yet your father , a man accustomed to judicial accusations , ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally ; it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against the assassin . <EOS>	99.24806213378906
The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court , was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal . <EOS>	103.0134506225586

Is there any difficulty in the way ? ” “ No. ” replied the captain , “ but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port. ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Monte Cristo although uninhabited , yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica , Sardinia , and Africa , and if it becomes known that we have been there , we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn. ” “ The deuce ! <EOS>	67.54843139648438

“ No ; for your skill with the sword is so well known. ” “ Ah ? —who has betrayed me ? ” “ The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered. ” “ And you failed ? ” “ They positively refused. ” “ Morrel , ” said the count , “ have you ever seen me fire a pistol ? ” “ Never. ” “ Well , we have time ; look. ” Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered , and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate , with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club . <EOS>	62.05397415161133

But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure , without arms to defend himself ? <EOS>	97.74151611328125
He traversed a corridor , crossed a grand saloon , entered a library , and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing . <EOS>	66.39197540283203
Then , without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention , he asked for his telescope . <EOS>	59.20119094848633

They advanced about thirty paces , and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks , in which seats had been cut , not unlike sentry-boxes . <EOS>	102.43208312988281
As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation . <EOS>	88.14674377441406
The president rang the bell . <EOS>	38.7317008972168
The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke , a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal , who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of Austria . <EOS>	103.18153381347656

Then , resuming his mild air , “ You are deceived , gentlemen , ” said he , “ this handkerchief is not mine , and I can not fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you ; and as a proof of what I say , here is mine in my pocket. ” So saying , he pulled out his own handkerchief , likewise a very elegant handkerchief , and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the period—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms , only ornamented with a single cipher , that of its proprietor . <EOS>	93.09964752197266

“ At another time , ” added he , “ I should have said , Give them , besides , two hundred francs over as a present ; but times are changed , and the little money that remains to me is not my own , so do not think me mean on this account. ” Penelon turned to his companions , and exchanged a few words with them . <EOS>	59.05860900878906
I can just suit you. ” “ Ah ! ” said Porthos , brightening , “ that ’ s well as regards my horse ; but I must have the appointments complete , as they include objects which a Musketeer alone can purchase , and which will not amount , besides , to more than three hundred livres. ” “ Three hundred livres ? <EOS>	78.14595031738281

Another recollection contributed also to sadden Raoul : on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived , hidden behind a screen of poplars , a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of La Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it , and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to Olivain ’ s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention . <EOS>	261.19757080078125

I had chosen this text—tell me , dear D ’ Artagnan , if it is not to your taste— ‘ _Non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_ ’ ; that is , ‘ A little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord. ’ ” “ Stop there ! ” cried the Jesuit , “ for that thesis touches closely upon heresy . <EOS>	137.56179809570312

The curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_ , from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary , are all engaged on the stage at the same time ; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude , or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of volition , influenced the moving mass . <EOS>	156.04421997070312
“ Why does not he go about his business ? ” “ Stupid fellow yourself ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse , and answering on his side through the carriage window . <EOS>	41.93525695800781
He was spoken of as the most adroit , the strongest , and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around ; and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines , no one had ever spoken to her of love , because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa . <EOS>	74.90568542480469

Ghosts At first sight , the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications of splendor , nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo ; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master , who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside . <EOS>	149.03701782226562
“ Mother , ” he said , turning towards Mercédès , “ this is M.

Absence severs as well as death , and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone. ” 0056m “ Yes ; but one gets out of prison , ” said Caderousse , who , with what sense was left him , listened eagerly to the conversation , “ and when one gets out and one ’ s name is Edmond Dantès , one seeks revenge—— ” “ What matters that ? ” muttered Fernand . <EOS>	88.84325408935547
He had but one fault—he was a gourmand ; he had found the pates good , the wine excellent . <EOS>	173.11233520507812
Often in prison Faria had said to him , when he saw him idle and inactive : “ Dantès , you must not give way to this listlessness ; you will be drowned if you seek to escape , and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion. ” These words rang in Dantès ’ ears , even beneath the waves ; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength . <EOS>	88.29191589355469

What I know is , that , like a fool , a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now , I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen , with a beardless chin and slim waist , and who , just as I was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips , placed a pistol to my head , and , aided by seven or eight others , led , or rather dragged me , to the Catacombs of St. Sebastian , where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Cæsar ’ s _Commentaries_ , and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me , that unless the next morning , before six o ’ clock , four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker ’ s , at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist . <EOS>	136.53268432617188

All I have is at his service. ” The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper ; then , observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded , he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show , and therefore said , speaking with a strong Italian accent , “ You are , I presume , M. Caderousse ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered the host , even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it ; “ I am Gaspard Caderousse , at your service. ” “ Gaspard Caderousse , ” rejoined the priest . <EOS>	96.3851547241211

There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant ; women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms ; and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs , savoring of the man of quality a league off . <EOS>	253.90377807617188

“ We shall go out all the same. ” “ Do you know , my dear fellow , why master pastrycooks never work with their hands ? ” “ No , ” said Porthos , “ but I should be glad to be informed. ” “ It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked. ” “ What then ? ” “ Why , then they would be laughed at , and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at. ” “ And what have master pastrycooks to do with us ? ” “ We ought , in our adventures , never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us . <EOS>	72.92723083496094

For a week since he had resolved to die , and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose , Edmond had not spoken to the attendant , had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him , and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him ; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it , and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments . <EOS>	75.05968475341797

This rough appeal , marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French , was uttered with such impenetrable expression that Gondy , clever physiognomist as he was , had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued . <EOS>	190.03152465820312

Suppose , for instance , the prisoner , as is more than probable , to have served under Napoleon—well , can you expect for an instant , that one accustomed , at the word of his commander , to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe , will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy , than to slaughter his fellow-creatures , merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey ? <EOS>	138.19775390625

Immediately the aldermen , clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants , each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand , went to attend upon the king , whom they met on the steps , where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome—a compliment to which his Majesty replied with an apology for coming so late , laying the blame upon the cardinal , who had detained him till eleven o ’ clock , talking of affairs of state . <EOS>	154.51303100585938

Well , that was a temptation for two wretches like you . <EOS>	123.10655212402344
I have , ” returned Guitant . <EOS>	31.770193099975586
A cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there . <EOS>	240.49581909179688
“ Well , then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the society . <EOS>	37.11832046508789
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead , but drew back when the waiter was presented to him ; he took no refreshment . <EOS>	46.72232437133789
Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak . <EOS>	123.0553207397461
Maximilian ’ s Avowal At the same moment M. de Villefort ’ s voice was heard calling from his study , “ What is the matter ? ” Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his self-command , and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances , he had taken refuge . <EOS>	53.250328063964844
Well , undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings ; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant ; and repeat often and loudly , so that all may know it , that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin , her lover and her destroyer ; begin this work to-day , this instant even , and in three days I shall expect the result . <EOS>	168.30731201171875
Pearls fell drop by drop , as subterranean waters filter in their caves . <EOS>	1050.3814697265625
Thus , in all their dreams , their wishes , and their conversations , Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel , general of an army , or governor of a province . <EOS>	113.20549011230469
Was this love a simple political affair , or was it naturally one of those profound passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her ? <EOS>	140.30967712402344
Still more , the light which had shone for an instant disappeared , and all was again in obscurity . <EOS>	79.69886779785156
“ Foreigner ! ” he ejaculated , “ Italian ! <EOS>	38.207035064697266
This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porthos . <EOS>	146.08966064453125
“ Brute ! ” said Danglars . <EOS>	14.246969223022461
He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer , although the latter was , if possible , more taciturn than the old one ; but still , to speak to a man , even though mute , was something . <EOS>	78.35030364990234
We will see , gentlemen , we will see . <EOS>	25.0832462310791
At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared ; then the queen , with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents , repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the subject . <EOS>	79.85502624511719
Return to Greenwich and bring them here . <EOS>	138.81666564941406
Neither of them spoke to him ; they merely stood aside to let him pass by , as usual , nothing more . <EOS>	133.1072540283203
You might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark. ” “ I agree with you , monsieur , ” said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion , “ such consequences would be extremely unpleasant. ” “ Nevertheless , you must not exaggerate the evil , ” said Monte Cristo , “ for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another . <EOS>	56.71229553222656
The chief approached , and it was indeed Planchet ; D ’ Artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant . <EOS>	33.54002380371094
Now , the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes ; and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pygmean. ” He went to find Aramis . <EOS>	87.26119995117188
The cardinal was lavish to his underlings. ” “ Yes , yes , Guitant , ” said Mazarin ; “ Richelieu was a great man , a very great man , but he had that defect . <EOS>	30.233564376831055
“ With whom are you going to fight ? ” “ With Beauchamp. ” “ One of your friends ! ” “ Of course ; it is always with friends that one fights. ” “ I suppose you have some cause of quarrel ? ” “ I have. ” 40094m “ What has he done to you ? ” “ There appeared in his journal last night—but wait , and read for yourself. ” And Albert handed over the paper to the count , who read as follows : “ A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance . <EOS>	68.4916763305664
When a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished ; when one is a murderer , to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan. ” These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had anticipated . <EOS>	147.97116088867188
The same day the will was made , the witnesses were brought , it was approved by the old man , sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to M. Deschamps , the family notary . <EOS>	83.84687805175781
I will read you the first canto . <EOS>	46.49443435668945
Bonacieux , “ so much happiness is not in store for me ! ” “ Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time , a sort of race , which should arrive first . <EOS>	83.82708740234375
Look at that wall—without a single window—which tells you fine things about Mazarin ’ s gratitude ! ” “ Yes , ” replied De Comminges , “ more especially if it could reveal how Monsieur d ’ Artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him. ” “ Poor D ’ Artagnan ’ ” said Athos , with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character , “ so brave , so good , so terrible to the enemies of those he loves . <EOS>	78.55489349365234
Porthos had not only been well received by the company , but he was moreover looked on with great admiration . <EOS>	43.91785430908203
What , above all , manifested the shrewdness of the steward , and the profound science of the master , the one in carrying out the ideas of the other , was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy , impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time , had in a single day acquired the aspect of life , was scented with its master ’ s favorite perfumes , and had the very light regulated according to his wish . <EOS>	128.97900390625
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat , and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice , “ Let the justice of God be done ! ” and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters , which closed over it . <EOS>	53.14112854003906
Danglars fancied that they had reached the long-desired point ; he opened his eyes and looked through the window , expecting to find himself in the midst of some town , or at least village ; but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin , where three or four men went and came like shadows . <EOS>	60.715023040771484
“ Our wine ! ” said Athos , astonished . <EOS>	13.16132926940918
Then obeying the orders given him by Athos , he headed the small procession , bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other , until it reached De Winter ’ s inn , when pounding on the portal with his fist , he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word . <EOS>	100.54081726074219
As if the Catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions ! <EOS>	97.93041229248047
At this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot ; the veins of the throat swelled ; his cheeks and temples became purple , as though he was struck with epilepsy ; nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry . <EOS>	94.95484924316406
Happiness comes to meet him , does it not , Monsieur Bonacieux ? ” Bonacieux became as pale as death , and grinned a ghastly smile . <EOS>	70.73042297363281
Advancing a few steps toward the queen , he knelt down . <EOS>	142.55763244628906
This did not seem sufficient ; the man , or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass , and drank it . <EOS>	128.38613891601562
I would arrest ten of them , _ventrebleu_ , a hundred , even , all the company , and I would not allow a whisper. ” “ From the moment they are suspected by your Majesty , ” said Tréville , “ the Musketeers are guilty ; therefore , you see me prepared to surrender my sword—for after having accused my soldiers , there can be no doubt that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me . <EOS>	92.8604965209961
Maximilian , who was paying them a visit , listened to their conversation , or rather was present at it , plunged in his accustomed state of apathy . <EOS>	98.41304016113281
“ Alas ! <EOS>	15.191644668579102
“ Come in , ” said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion ; and immediately Beauchamp appeared . <EOS>	48.092159271240234
“ No , ” said Morrel ; “ I am not mistaken . <EOS>	7.434988021850586
I believe , while the Countess G—— takes you for Lord Ruthven , my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain . <EOS>	179.43399047851562
“ Yes , sir , ” replied Raoul , with slight hesitation ; “ I did not sleep well. ” “ You , Raoul , not sleep well ! <EOS>	28.007387161254883
I must then place my life , my honor , my reputation , in your hands ? ” “ Yes , yes , madame , you must ; and I will save them all. ” “ But how ? <EOS>	28.774791717529297
The young man felt her press his hand , and comprehended that this was a sentiment , not of coquetry , but of gratitude because of his departure . <EOS>	71.90274047851562
He had stopped , like Raoul , at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle , the best at Compiegne ; and had started again on his journey , saying that he should sleep at Noyon . <EOS>	66.28654479980469
“ There , do you hear ? ” observed Gaetano ; “ he is bidding you adieu. ” The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air , but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore . <EOS>	40.95582962036133
Why didn ’ t they search more vigilantly ? <EOS>	219.06594848632812

As for the count , he just touched the dishes ; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests , and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food . <EOS>	83.2391357421875
I swear to you , sir , should any harm befall me , your name will be the last name that I shall utter , the remembrance of you my last thought. ” Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion , and regained with hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses . <EOS>	94.51368713378906
But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown , who remained standing before the Musketeer , drew back with signs of terror , and refused . <EOS>	82.46980285644531
They arrived thus , screened by the lining of the trench , till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion . <EOS>	43.7374153137207
‘ Why , the good God sends him back again. ’ Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair . <EOS>	115.95558166503906
“ It is a false diamond , ” said Caderousse . <EOS>	13.573873519897461
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin . <EOS>	86.1153335571289
Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen . <EOS>	86.5278549194336
Speak quickly , friend. ” The man said , in a low voice : “ I wish—I wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris . <EOS>	62.02335739135742
The weather was magnificent , and the excursion a treat . <EOS>	91.1343994140625
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket , and tying a knot at each corner—the signal agreed upon—waved it in the air and the man came up to him . <EOS>	105.17657470703125
He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d ’ Or . <EOS>	149.5087890625
A handkerchief , tied at the four corners , is to be the signal. ” Next moment D ’ Artagnan entered . <EOS>	81.15851593017578
But you , my dear Athos—you , who so generously distributed the Englishman ’ s pistoles , which were our legitimate property—what do you mean to do ? ” “ I am satisfied with having killed that fellow , my boy , seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an Englishman ; but if I had pocketed his pistoles , they would have weighed me down like a remorse. ” “ Go to , my dear Athos ; you have truly inconceivable ideas. ” “ Let it pass . <EOS>	90.70350646972656
“ Go on ; who were those men ? ” “ One of them was a foreigner , English , I think . <EOS>	43.60877227783203

His eyes glittered with delight . <EOS>	56.069435119628906
“ Begone , then , to your beautiful duchess ; I will detain you no longer. ” “ And she is not to be despised , in my opinion. ” “ Now , Monsieur Porthos , once more , and this is the last ! <EOS>	41.93641662597656

Having escaped these dangers , they returned by the main road to Boulogne , at Abbeville , and followed it step by step , examining every track . <EOS>	180.80613708496094
The hour came for him to retire . <EOS>	30.653940200805664
“ I am at your service , sir , ” said the abbé , with a marked Italian accent . <EOS>	14.61720085144043
“ No , sir. ” “ And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you ? ” “ A glass of wine will be extremely welcome. ” “ The fish bites—the fish bites ! ” whispered the Gascon to Porthos . <EOS>	44.793880462646484
He then returned to Paris , and although in the same carriage with Château-Renaud and Albert , he did not hear one word of their conversation . <EOS>	37.39348220825195
Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel. ” “ Come when he will , it shall be kept for him . <EOS>	65.57203674316406

We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on ; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman ’ s word , and that as he had said the horse was his , it must be so. ” “ That ’ s Porthos all over , ” murmured D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	54.293827056884766
Still confidence was not restored to all minds , and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month . <EOS>	117.17181396484375
The next day , in fact , at daybreak , the court made preparations to quit Saint Germain . <EOS>	39.355587005615234
They then dressed themselves . <EOS>	214.85740661621094
Cocles went first , and the stranger followed him . <EOS>	45.81901550292969
General d ’ Épinay died five minutes after. ’ ” Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible , and then stopped , passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud ; but after a moment ’ s silence , he continued : “ ‘ The president went up the steps , after pushing his sword into his cane ; a track of blood on the snow marked his course . <EOS>	63.741825103759766
He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion , were it even the mad abbé . <EOS>	159.91290283203125
I was not rich ; my life was in constant danger ; I could not seek them , to my great regret. ’ The president frowned imperceptibly . <EOS>	93.31356048583984
“ I think so , indeed ; we should be hard to please if we were not . <EOS>	36.56502914428711
Winter , give the necessary orders. ” Winter then left the tent ; in the meantime the king finished his toilet . <EOS>	133.16357421875
To-day it ’ s a sort of diplomatic arrangement ; ask Planchet. ” Mousqueton inquired , therefore , the state of the case of his old friend , who confirmed the statement of D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	112.97786712646484
“ Oh , second father , ” he exclaimed , “ thou who hast given me liberty , knowledge , riches ; thou who , like beings of a superior order to ourselves , couldst understand the science of good and evil ; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth ; if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered , —then , noble heart , sublime soul , then I conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me , by the filial obedience I vowed to thee , grant me some sign , some revelation ! <EOS>	241.8880157470703
Her eyes , however , betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire . <EOS>	141.70443725585938

A vast crowd filled the apartments of Saint Germain . <EOS>	65.72933959960938
This was all that M. de Tréville wanted . <EOS>	31.849210739135742

Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole , but he kept the faded one in his hand ; and when he again met the calash , he raised it to his lips , an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it , but her joyous companions also . <EOS>	79.74231719970703

He resolved , then , to defend the door bravely ; and as , betrayed by the mistress of the inn , he could not say that Aramis was absent , he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference , which had commenced with the morning and would not , as Bazin said , terminate before night . <EOS>	83.29198455810547
The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all , for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening , and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them . <EOS>	104.99378204345703
Dantès examined it with intense admiration , then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form . <EOS>	100.59323120117188

I do not understand you ? ” “ I mean , Mercédès , that you are thus harsh and cruel with me , because you are expecting someone who is thus attired ; but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant , or if he is not , the sea is so to him. ” “ Fernand , ” cried Mercédès , “ I believed you were good-hearted , and I was mistaken ! <EOS>	61.36931610107422
At first the king answered that he would not go ; but he could not resist his love of sport , and set out after dinner. ” “ And the king has seen the cardinal ? ” asked M. de Tréville . <EOS>	33.38386154174805
“ What ! ” said he , “ you have just lost one woman , whom you call good , charming , perfect ; and here you are , running headlong after another. ” D ’ Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach . <EOS>	49.132537841796875
The handle of this saucepan was of iron ; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it . <EOS>	61.01325607299805
Aramis continued , “ And yet , while I do belong to the earth , I wish to speak of you—of our friends. ” “ And on my part , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I wished to speak of you , but I find you so completely detached from everything ! <EOS>	29.60084342956543
Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me ? ” “ How , dear sister ! ” said Lord de Winter . <EOS>	50.286277770996094
Then D ’ Artagnan , being alone , struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder , mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers . <EOS>	40.5138053894043
“ _Pardieu_ , monsieur ! ” said Athos , “ that ’ s a proposition that pleases me ; not that I can accept it , but a league off it savors of the gentleman . <EOS>	39.468936920166016

President , —I can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the Lieutenant-General the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in Macedonia with important particulars. ’ “ The president paused , and the count turned pale . <EOS>	141.92874145507812
He meditates . <EOS>	292.6360778808594
I always knew you were a good son. ” “ And , ” inquired Dantès , with some hesitation , “ do you know how my father is ? ” “ Well , I believe , my dear Edmond , though I have not seen him lately. ” “ Yes , he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room. ” “ That proves , at least , that he has wanted for nothing during your absence. ” Dantès smiled . <EOS>	33.19402313232422
It is men whom I should hold responsible , and I will hold them responsible. ” “ Be seated , Juxon , ” said the king , falling upon his knees . <EOS>	42.218807220458984

“ A Greek ? ” murmured the Count of Morcerf . <EOS>	13.48064136505127
He was dressed in plain clothes , and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged . <EOS>	108.02369689941406
The stranger , then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery , drew his sword , saluted his adversary , and seriously placed himself on guard . <EOS>	130.73660278320312
If my mother could know of this attention on your part—and I will venture to tell her—I am sure that she will be most grateful to you ; it is true that my father will be equally angry. ” The count laughed . <EOS>	62.099796295166016
At nine o ’ clock next morning she arose , and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity , she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night ; then running downstairs , she left the hotel , walked to the Rue de Provence , called a cab , and drove to M. de Villefort ’ s house . <EOS>	57.79988479614258
He guessed , likewise , by induction , that Porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of Chantilly , when the procurator ’ s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse . <EOS>	91.33503723144531

“ I am giving them the slip , ” said Eugénie ; “ this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty ; we will soon alter our direction. ” And the young girl jumped into the britzka , which was admirably arranged for sleeping in , without scarcely touching the step . <EOS>	70.9362564086914
“ Why , ” replied Athos , carelessly , “ she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned Musketeer , named Athos , has taken her safe-conduct from her by force ; she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends , Aramis and Porthos , at the same time . <EOS>	39.42918014526367

Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin. ” “ That ’ s all very well , ” replied D ’ Artagnan ; “ but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Milady. ” “ You are very fastidious , ” said Athos ; “ such a beautiful woman ! ” “ A woman of mark ! ” said Porthos , with his loud laugh . <EOS>	40.89800262451172

_Le Blanc_ was not a fast animal , but he kept up an easy , steady pace ; in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from Compiègne , and four o ’ clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop . <EOS>	141.8865203857422
I repeat it , D ’ Artagnan , you are the best one among us ; I bless and love you , my dear son. ” “ And to think that I couldn ’ t find that out , ” said Porthos , scratching his head ; “ it is so simple. ” “ But , ” said Aramis , “ if I understand rightly we are to kill them all , eh ? ” Athos shuddered and turned pale . <EOS>	30.556337356567383
Besides , you know , I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to France . <EOS>	63.93012237548828

Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me , and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else ; it is for that reason , perhaps , that they do not quit me. ” They had long since passed to dessert and cigars . <EOS>	73.08872985839844
“ So , ” D ’ Artagnan resumed , “ you will not become a partisan of Mazarin ’ s ? ” “ Nor you of the Prince de Condé ? ” “ No , let us belong to no party , but remain friends ; let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists. ” “ Adieu , then. ” And D ’ Artagnan poured out a glass of wine . <EOS>	31.745380401611328

It frequently occurs in a state prison like this , that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners. ” “ But they believe I am shut up alone here. ” “ That makes no difference. ” “ And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here ? ” “ I do ; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine ; only , unfortunately , I did not curve aright ; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion , instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet , I made it fifty . <EOS>	134.60154724121094

Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller , but , to his great surprise , the latter , without seeking for the signatures , many of which , indeed , were only initials , named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him , but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him . <EOS>	94.61627197265625
Suppose that the Supreme Being , after having created the world and fertilized chaos , had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes ; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was good—suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night—then—even then , Mercédès , you could not imagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment. ” Mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment , her admiration , and her gratitude . <EOS>	188.2069549560547

The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance , closed the door of the study , and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine . <EOS>	67.95812225341797

“ Listen ; I am the only man in the world having the right to say to you , ‘ Morrel , your father ’ s son shall not die today ; ’ ” and Monte Cristo , with an expression of majesty and sublimity , advanced with arms folded toward the young man , who , involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man , recoiled a step . <EOS>	46.499122619628906
Mordaunt , one of my secretaries , will remit this letter of introduction to His Eminence , the Cardinal Mazarin , in Paris . <EOS>	84.71489715576172

He laid every action of his life before the Almighty , proposed tasks to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God : “ Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. ” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers , Dantès remained a prisoner . <EOS>	221.57742309570312

“ Upon my word , ” said Albert , “ you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess. ” “ You are mistaken in thinking so , ” returned Franz calmly ; “ but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders , —I mean that of judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions ; believe me , nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon ; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess—nothing more. ” “ Is there , indeed , my good fellow ? <EOS>	107.31781005859375

Faria had dug his way through fifty feet , Dantès would dig a hundred ; Faria , at the age of fifty , had devoted three years to the task ; he , who was but half as old , would sacrifice six ; Faria , a priest and savant , had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume , Rattonneau , or Lemaire ; should a hardy sailor , an experienced diver , like himself , shrink from a similar task ; should he , who had so often for mere amusement ’ s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch , hesitate to entertain the same project ? <EOS>	199.529541015625
