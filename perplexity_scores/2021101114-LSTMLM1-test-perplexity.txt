“ Go , Valentine , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , “ and leave me with this gentleman. ” “ But , grandmamma—— ” “ Leave me—go ! ” The young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room . <EOS>	58.4562873840332

There were collected and piled up all Albert ’ s successive caprices , hunting-horns , bass-viols , flutes—a whole orchestra , for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; easels , palettes , brushes , pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting ; foils , boxing-gloves , broadswords , and single-sticks—for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , Albert de Morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy ’ s education , i.e. , fencing , boxing , and single-stick ; and it was here that he received Grisier , Cooks , and Charles Leboucher . <EOS>	1101.0770263671875
“ ‘ No , ’ said Caderousse , ‘ we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs. ’ “ ‘ As you please , my dear sir , ’ said the jeweller ; ‘ I had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin. ’ And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold , and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper , and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes . <EOS>	79.12889099121094

Upon gaining this advantage D ’ Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! <EOS>	113.36392211914062
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked , ‘ How do they execute at Rome ? ’ and you reply , ‘ I do not know ! ’ And , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son . <EOS>	145.90733337402344

At this announcement , during which the door remained open , everyone became mute , and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber , and entered the apartment of the captain of the Musketeers , congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel . <EOS>	123.07908630371094

“ Why are not my Frenchmen here ? ” he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment ; “ they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive , and of their tears when dead. ” “ Well , ” said the president , seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent , “ so be it . <EOS>	103.89270782470703
“ One plan occurred to me , ” continued Albert ; “ Franz likes all that is eccentric ; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most alluring style , he invariably answered : ‘ My eccentricity may be great , but it will not make me break my promise. ’ ” “ That is what I call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself. ” Albert smiled . <EOS>	139.2469940185547
“ You seem secretly elated. ” “ Yes , Giulio , ” she said , “ proud and happy ; for I have found the means of strangling this hydra. ” “ You are a great politician , my queen , ” said Mazarin ; “ let us hear the means. ” And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper . <EOS>	126.7178955078125

what ’ s that ? ” “ The Lightning , ” answered the captain , “ our felucca. ” “ So far , so good , ” laughed Athos . <EOS>	55.94162368774414
“ Yes ; you said you had an idea , ” said Athos . <EOS>	40.064456939697266

Immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators ; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the _Pharaon_ , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old Phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city . <EOS>	258.936279296875

Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward ’ s extraordinary repugnance for the count ’ s projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey . <EOS>	234.96182250976562
He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant , and as the protection of the general , who is in the highest favor , was accorded to him , he was a captain in 1823 , during the Spanish war—that is to say , at the time when Danglars made his early speculations . <EOS>	165.33544921875

We have secured him. ” “ Yes , ” said Aramis , “ through an infamous act of treason. ” Porthos pressed his friend ’ s hand and said to him : “ Yes , sir , all is fair in war , stratagem as well as force ; look yonder ! ” At this instant the squadron , that ought to have protected Charles ’ s retreat , was advancing to meet the English regiments . <EOS>	95.27899932861328
Now , as D ’ Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights , it was upon him that all the felicitations fell , which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis abandoned to him , not only as good comrades , but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his . <EOS>	117.12277221679688
Let me fight like a woman , then ; my strength is in my weakness. ” Then , as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance , so mobile and so expressive , she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger , which convulsed her features , to that of the most sweet , most affectionate , and most seducing smile . <EOS>	275.1548156738281

30083m The curtain rose , as usual , to an almost empty house , it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance , so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it , that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals , while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors , and the buzz of conversation . <EOS>	283.20867919921875

Meantime , Monsieur , who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d ’ Angoulême , by Bassompierre , or by Schomberg , who were all eager for his post , did but little , lost his days in wavering , and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Ré , where they still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée , as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle . <EOS>	166.68638610839844

The queen was still standing when he entered ; but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair , and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools , and with an air of supreme hauteur , said , “ What do you desire , monsieur , and with what object do you present yourself here ? ” “ To make , madame , in the name of the king , and without prejudice to the respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close examination into all your papers. ” “ How , monsieur , an investigation of my papers—mine ! <EOS>	97.6205062866211

When he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him ; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this : “ We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs , and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again. ” Unfortunately , whether through envy or stupidity , all Morrel ’ s correspondents did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision . <EOS>	283.1022644042969

What matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should languish in prison , the victim of an infamous denunciation , to die here cursing his executioners. ” “ You are very humble today , ” remarked the governor ; “ you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey. ” “ It is true , sir , and I beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but I was mad. ” “ And you are not so any longer ? ” “ No ; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long. ” “ So long ? —when were you arrested , then ? ” asked the inspector . <EOS>	97.01497650146484

The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed , and which indeed have survived them , of the procurators of the period—meanness , stinginess , fasts ; but as , after all , excepting some few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable , the procurator ’ s wife had been tolerably liberal—that is , be it understood , for a procurator ’ s wife—he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind . <EOS>	463.30950927734375

She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the Prince de Marsillac , the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld , whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Condé , her brother-in-law , whom she now hated mortally . <EOS>	189.98016357421875

The Count de Villeroy said that “ he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment , when the court had , to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris , his holiness the coadjutor , who by a signal could raise an army of curates , church porters and vergers. ” The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat , as Henry IV . <EOS>	193.01368713378906

I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually , and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship , the _Pharaon_ , did not come into port on the 15th , he would be wholly unable to make this payment. ” “ But , ” said the Englishman , “ this looks very much like a suspension of payment. ” “ It looks more like bankruptcy ! ” exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly . <EOS>	136.386474609375
“ But in either case , what is to be done ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	23.92036247253418

But I swear to you , before God who hears us , that if you betray me , and my enemies pardon me , I will kill myself , while accusing you of my death. ” “ And I—I swear to you before God , madame , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me , I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone. ” Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the Samaritaine . <EOS>	92.18817138671875

To this dumb language , which was so unintelligible to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration , united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses . <EOS>	369.23602294921875

Toward eleven o ’ clock the king entered the hall , surrounded by guards , but wearing his head covered , and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance , as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects , rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court . <EOS>	137.05319213867188

Albert went to his room , and dressed with unusual care . <EOS>	77.86660766601562
“ His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had , ” he said , “ given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships ’ orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion. ” They resolved to profit by the count ’ s courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained . <EOS>	184.39955139160156
I was like you , and had a king in keeping. ” “ Aha ! ” said Groslow ; “ what king ? ” “ Our own , to be sure , the little one—Louis XIV. ” “ And how long had you to take care of him ? ” “ Three nights ; and , by my troth , I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure. ” “ How do you mean ? ” “ I mean that my friends , officers in the guards and mousquetaires , came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting , drinking , dicing. ” “ Ah true , ” said the Englishman , with a sigh ; “ you Frenchmen are born boon companions. ” “ And don ’ t you play , too , when you are on guard ? ” “ Never , ” said the Englishman . <EOS>	87.8400650024414

“ Your pardon , my officer , ” said Athos ; “ but we were ignorant with whom we had to do , and you may see that we were keeping good guard. ” “ Your name ? ” said the officer , who covered a part of his face with his cloak . <EOS>	37.644718170166016

You can understand that one of two things must have happened ; he must either have fallen flat , in which case the blow , from a height of ninety feet , must have killed him instantly , or he must have fallen upright , and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom , where he remained—poor fellow ! ” “ Then you pity him ? ” said the count . <EOS>	112.65552520751953

The usher returned and made a sign to D ’ Artagnan to follow him . <EOS>	38.7182502746582
“ What is that ? ” asked D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	8.272974967956543
Look at Monsieur Mouston , see the honorable wounds he has received , observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance. ” Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced D ’ Artagnan had he dared ; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself . <EOS>	267.1640625
Then I admit my patience failed me ; I drew my sword in my turn , and as he came back to the charge , I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me , he let it pass through his body . <EOS>	126.24397277832031

“ I will be silent , then , ” said Milady , casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice , with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner . <EOS>	77.15325164794922
Furthermore , D ’ Artagnan went with them , leaving Porthos at play with Groslow . <EOS>	94.31074523925781
Unfortunately for D ’ Artagnan , among the spectators was one of his Eminence ’ s Guardsmen , who , still irritated by the defeat of his companions , which had happened only the day before , had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it . <EOS>	64.53253936767578
He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged , though in a handsome manner ; but he claimed two hours a day to himself , consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants . <EOS>	199.52098083496094

“ I respected your father very much , ” said he . <EOS>	42.30646896362305

“ Bertuccio , ” said he , “ give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur. ” The steward left the room with a faltering step , and returned with a bundle of bank-notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there . <EOS>	113.51506042480469
After the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . <EOS>	204.46511840820312

To my offer of liberty , he replied that it was nothing but a snare , and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions . <EOS>	97.39862823486328

As to what may lie before us , it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought . <EOS>	178.2147216796875
“ But , my good gentleman , ” resumed the old man , upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done , “ do not take on so ; they did not kill her , and that ’ s a comfort. ” “ Can you guess , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ who was the man who headed this infernal expedition ? ” “ I don ’ t know him. ” “ But as you spoke to him you must have seen him. ” “ Oh , it ’ s a description you want ? ” “ Exactly so. ” “ A tall , dark man , with black mustaches , dark eyes , and the air of a gentleman. ” “ That ’ s the man ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , “ again he , forever he ! <EOS>	55.7782096862793

Do you remember , Aramis , that it was here he received that famous bullet wound ? ” “ By my faith , ’ twould be excusable in him to tremble , ” replied Aramis , “ for even I feel a shudder at the recollection ; hold , just above that tree is the little spot where I thought I was killed. ” It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past . <EOS>	184.76007080078125
You will not oppose M.

Well , try the Hotel de Luynes , Raoul , and ask if the duchess can receive you . <EOS>	103.30864715576172

“ Quite , quite alone , ” replied the man— “ or , at least , practically so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing ! ” “ You are married , then ? ” said the priest , with a show of interest , glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	103.83897399902344
“ See what an exordium ! ” cried the Jesuit . <EOS>	84.6708755493164

You will hear again from me. ” “ Come , come , ” thought D ’ Artagnan , emerging from behind the curtain , “ decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool ; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school. ” The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another , without uttering a single word ; the queen standing near the door , D ’ Artagnan half out of his hiding place , the king raised on his elbow , ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude , but instead of approaching , the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away . <EOS>	126.5079116821289
“ Speak , doctor—I am listening , ” said Villefort ; “ strike—I am prepared for everything ! ” “ Madame de Saint-Méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health. ” Morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes . <EOS>	183.8402099609375
Every one hoped so , so that the minister felt that all around him , beneath the homage of the courtiers , lay a fund of hatred , ill disguised by fear and interest . <EOS>	206.02838134765625
“ Ah , is that you , D ’ Artagnan , and you , Athos ? ” said the young man . <EOS>	15.741693496704102
Numberless groups paraded the streets and , whatever D ’ Artagnan might think of it , it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance , in order to assume a warlike aspect . <EOS>	240.09033203125
an affair for the police ! <EOS>	125.47064208984375
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge ; such learning is very rare among ladies. ” “ Oh , I am aware of that , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ but I have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are reducible to figures , like an algebraic equation ; but go on , I beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree. ” 30069m “ Well , ” replied Monte Cristo “ suppose , then , that this poison was brucine , and you were to take a milligramme the first day , two milligrammes the second day , and so on . <EOS>	151.42660522460938
“ What is the matter ? <EOS>	26.191139221191406
Now , Planchet has an excellent memory ; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance , he will allow himself to be beaten to death . <EOS>	135.412109375
On his left was Porthos , whilst D ’ Artagnan was on his right ; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side . <EOS>	114.59979248046875
A strange thing is the mind , and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign , a word , a hope . <EOS>	154.57418823242188
Why ? ” “ Just remember what they said . <EOS>	75.1794662475586
It was like the eve of a battle ; the heart beat , the eyes laughed , and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose , was , after all , a good thing . <EOS>	100.87523651123047
“ Yes . <EOS>	46.83610534667969
The last Count of Spada , moreover , made me his heir , bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary , he bequeathed to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point . <EOS>	301.2513122558594
That ’ s too many , gentlemen , too many ! <EOS>	70.42733764648438
“ Yes , no doubt . <EOS>	31.160173416137695
Well , do you understand , monsieur ? <EOS>	25.445110321044922
“ Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors. ” Milady held out her hand to him . <EOS>	156.13949584960938
She appeared to be in ecstasy , and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her . <EOS>	91.51172637939453
A lady , it was said , had just fainted ; they had supplied her with a smelling-bottle , and she had recovered . <EOS>	95.29940032958984
Stand here , don ’ t stir , turn your back to the road and wait for me. ” Having thus spoken , D ’ Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village . <EOS>	172.85595703125
Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of Athos than I have ; but I like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves . <EOS>	748.408203125
At Pontoise he changed his horse for the last time , and at nine o ’ clock galloped into the yard of Tréville ’ s hôtel . <EOS>	66.54492950439453
The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him . <EOS>	77.15748596191406
“ I can not have deceived myself , ” he said ; “ I must look upon the past in a false light . <EOS>	39.23809051513672
“ And what , ” he continued , “ has been done with the poor body ? ” “ By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it . <EOS>	73.59610748291016
“ Well , you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says , ” replied Athos , shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity . <EOS>	49.86947250366211
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here ; it was that he might form some resolution , adopt some plan . <EOS>	280.25494384765625
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act . <EOS>	183.36997985839844
“ Still , then , I am a prisoner , ” said Milady , looking around her , and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer ; “ but I feel assured it will not be for long , ” added she . <EOS>	39.22637939453125
Porthos had his fits . <EOS>	210.843505859375
“ Yes ; a passage of St. Augustine , upon which we could not agree , ” said the Gascon . <EOS>	60.785152435302734
it would be but an unsafe retreat . <EOS>	205.11849975585938
“ Ay , ” said Porthos , “ if we can not leave the camp , our lackeys may. ” “ To be sure they may ; and this very day we will write the letters , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	52.193115234375
Dantès , your health. ” Fernand rose impatiently . <EOS>	184.47836303710938
When I return , which will be in about an hour , you must offer him to me as a servant , and upon your recommendation , though he doesn ’ t speak a word of French , I take him into my service . <EOS>	64.92529296875
Divers descended in machines , made expressly on the discovery , into the bay where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves . <EOS>	259.87274169921875
A sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès , who must believe him dead . <EOS>	126.36068725585938
His head hanging down , his eye dull , his speech slow and painful , Athos would look for hours together at his bottle , his glass , or at Grimaud , who , accustomed to obey him by signs , read in the faint glance of his master his least desire , and satisfied it immediately . <EOS>	207.48997497558594
Take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains ; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever . <EOS>	233.56484985351562
“ The best swordsman in the kingdom , my lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	24.42601203918457
Constance ? ” replied the young man , “ where are you ? <EOS>	24.65320587158203
Their joy was great . <EOS>	402.3523864746094
They dined apart from one another , wherever they might happen to be , or rather where they could . <EOS>	233.26722717285156
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto , —Villefort having retired as well as Noirtier and d ’ Avrigny , —her thoughts wandered in a confused maze , alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard . <EOS>	343.5013122558594
It must , however , be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme . <EOS>	206.11326599121094
“ The idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes ! ” “ There is something in what you have just said , ” said Beauchamp , laughing . <EOS>	69.6864013671875
how does he come by his name—his fortune ? <EOS>	378.74420166015625
“ Give it to me , ” said D ’ Artagnan , who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket , reckoning upon returning by that gate . <EOS>	64.4010009765625
hey ! <EOS>	172.0450897216797
The weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself Jupiter . <EOS>	447.6409606933594
your honor , in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels. ” “ What then ? ” “ Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV. ” “ Well ? ” “ In these books , your honor , ’ tis told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with—— ” “ The fattest among them ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan , unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing . <EOS>	186.7583465576172
“ What am I to do ? ” she said , bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant . <EOS>	70.26571655273438
Submit this honour to somebody else. ” And he sat down . <EOS>	701.1206665039062
At the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard . <EOS>	162.5961456298828
For him those ten minutes were very long . <EOS>	174.7648162841797
“ How can you find out ? ” “ You shall see. ” Gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes ’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land . <EOS>	133.17626953125

Once past the frontier , Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds ; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres , which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all . <EOS>	560.2798461914062
Stop , there are a fine body of citizens passing ; quite attractive , by Jupiter ! <EOS>	313.7506408691406

Do you know in what crime you are to-day engaged ? <EOS>	136.5660858154297
Is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week ? ” asked the mercer , piqued to the quick . <EOS>	83.3478012084961
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness , when again I heard groans , mingled with half-stifled cries , as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle . <EOS>	489.6270751953125

“ He certainly bodes us no good , ” said Athos ; “ but let us embark ; once out at sea , let him come. ” And Athos sprang into the boat , which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers . <EOS>	233.19192504882812
The sergeant , with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity , said : “ Who are you , gentlemen ? ” “ Two gentlemen. ” “ And where do you come from ? ” “ From London. ” “ And what are you going to do in Paris ? ” “ We are going with a mission to Her Majesty , the Queen of England. ” “ Ah , every one seems to be going to see the queen of England . <EOS>	54.2157096862793
“ My son , ” said Anne of Austria , pointing to the musketeer , calm , standing uncovered , “ here is Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women . <EOS>	60.0485725402832
But this is droll , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , consoled , and holding his sides with laughter . <EOS>	61.19150924682617
Both went into the bedroom , and as the door of communication remained open , D ’ Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid . <EOS>	121.1201400756836
Monte Cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped . <EOS>	63.62749099731445
She turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master . <EOS>	84.9996337890625
“ To wait , ” replied Athos . <EOS>	24.180641174316406
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field , the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself . <EOS>	144.01174926757812

A sob was the only sound he heard . <EOS>	150.6934814453125
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet-de-chambre , who opened the door of the vestibule , then another which seemed to be that of a waiting-room , and showing them two stools : “ Your orders are very simple , ” he said ; “ don ’ t allow anybody , except one person , to enter here . <EOS>	145.47494506835938

Albert saw all these preparations and understood them , and exclaiming , “ My mother ! ” he threw his arms around her neck . <EOS>	87.04696655273438
De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been ; he rose , dignified and calm , restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man . <EOS>	125.3800277709961
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments , I shall find one both palpable and visible , on whom I shall revenge myself , I assure you , for all I have suffered during the last month . <EOS>	204.3102569580078

The president looked at his auditors . <EOS>	71.72042846679688

“ He brings an irreproachable name , which Maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the Legion of Honor. ” The old man signified that he recollected him . <EOS>	170.14013671875
The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès , probably never to behold her again . <EOS>	157.63162231445312
Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men ; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d ’ Avrigny , for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , — “ He is mad ! ” But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight . <EOS>	147.6935577392578
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime. ” “ Remember , ” answered the abbé calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , “ it is your fault , not mine , that I do so . <EOS>	131.99806213378906
d ’ Épinay can not leave the drawing-room at present. ” “ It is at this moment , ” replied Barrois with the same firmness , “ that M.

There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower-beds ; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure . <EOS>	763.8219604492188
It must have been for his hide , for , _certes_ , the carcass is not worth eighteen livres . <EOS>	305.0642395019531
“ Ah ! ” said he , raising himself on his elbow , “ is it you , Comte de la Fere ? ” “ Yes , sire , ” replied Athos . <EOS>	14.128857612609863
“ What ! ” demanded D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	14.906022071838379
“ If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin , we do not understand each other. ” “ I don ’ t say exactly , ” answered the Gascon , confused . <EOS>	44.207244873046875
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper , which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident , monotonous note . <EOS>	1538.4945068359375
There ! ” “ Let us dine , then , ” said Porthos ; “ it is getting cold. ” The friends , at ease with regard to the future , did honor to the repast , the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton , Bazin , Planchet , and Grimaud . <EOS>	72.59259796142578
“ Art thou dumb ? ” cried the duke . <EOS>	77.23312377929688

The two friends turned down the first street they came to . <EOS>	99.50133514404297
I sank on my knees , my hands clasped round one of the bedposts ; then I felt that I was lost. ” Felton became frightfully pale , and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body . <EOS>	226.54576110839844
“ Who told you so ? <EOS>	89.95135498046875

The trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street-door . <EOS>	98.54391479492188
“ Father , ” said Mercédès , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table , “ sit , I pray you , on my right hand ; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , ” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand ; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart . <EOS>	151.78509521484375
No ; how would you have me know ? ” Parry bent his head and whispered to the king : “ It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends. ” “ Raising my scaffold ! ” cried the king , astounded . <EOS>	59.62279510498047

One morning the gardener went to him and told him , as if to please him , that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use . <EOS>	107.15862274169922
It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every instant . <EOS>	158.43408203125
There he saw the grand-marshal , who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris , whose name I could not extract from him ; but this mission was to prepare men ’ s minds for a return ( it is the man who says this , sire ) —a return which will soon occur. ” “ And where is this man ? ” “ In prison , sire. ” “ And the matter seems serious to you ? ” “ So serious , sire , that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival , on the very day of my betrothal , I left my bride and friends , postponing everything , that I might hasten to lay at your majesty ’ s feet the fears which impressed me , and the assurance of my devotion. ” “ True , ” said Louis XVIII. , “ was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Daughter of one of your majesty ’ s most faithful servants. ” “ Yes , yes ; but let us talk of this plot , M. de Villefort. ” “ Sire , I fear it is more than a plot ; I fear it is a conspiracy. ” “ A conspiracy in these times , ” said Louis XVIII. , smiling , “ is a thing very easy to meditate , but more difficult to conduct to an end , inasmuch as , re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future . <EOS>	103.2802734375
This Noirtier was his father ! ” Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès , or hell opened its yawning gulf before him , he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words . <EOS>	177.08950805664062
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first , and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor . <EOS>	166.32101440429688
But what do I see in the water—something struggling ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” exclaimed Raoul , fixing his glance on one point in the stream , splendidly illumined by the setting sun , “ a horse , a rider ! ” “ They are sinking ! ” cried Olivain in his turn . <EOS>	77.88230895996094
He could already see the intendant ’ s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief . <EOS>	554.2979125976562
“ And Bazin ? ” asked Athos . <EOS>	24.117267608642578
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows . <EOS>	502.0093994140625

“ That will serve us for a relay , ” said Athos . <EOS>	40.33449935913086
D ’ Artagnan then thought of that cottage , silent and obscure , which had no doubt seen all , and could tell its tale . <EOS>	129.35076904296875
The sitting commences at two ; it is now three , and I am to speak. ” “ Go , then , and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence , ” replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling . <EOS>	75.71684265136719

He followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees . <EOS>	164.986328125
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow . <EOS>	153.46617126464844
D ’ Artagnan reassured her as well as he could , and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Milady . <EOS>	71.40778350830078
No , happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father ’ s actions . <EOS>	278.2115173339844
“ This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself , ” said Milady , replacing the glass upon the table , with an infernal smile , “ but , my faith ! <EOS>	45.16587448120117
MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD On the day after these events had taken place , Athos not having reappeared , M. de Tréville was informed by D ’ Artagnan and Porthos of the circumstance . <EOS>	156.3479461669922
The woman screamed , and cried for help ; but her cries were soon stifled . <EOS>	221.991455078125
Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me , and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require. ” This manner of acting roused much respect for D ’ Artagnan ’ s policy among the Musketeers . <EOS>	170.0655975341797
D ’ Artagnan was too grand to promise anything ; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name . <EOS>	108.16740417480469

We must confess these three strange names struck us ; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms , under which D ’ Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious , or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which , from caprice , discontent , or want of fortune , they had donned the simple Musketeer ’ s uniform . <EOS>	280.7740783691406

Totally disregarding the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman , aided by a powerful opera-glass ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing , were all so much engrossed with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass . <EOS>	245.0374298095703

“ Because , ” said the old man , “ the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it ; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty . <EOS>	232.5261688232422

“ My son , ” said the old Gascon gentleman , in that pure Béarn _patois_ of which Henry IV . <EOS>	208.11431884765625

They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant Adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . <EOS>	649.4898681640625

“ Now , then , to breakfast , ” said Beauchamp ; “ for , if I remember , you told me you only expected two persons , Albert. ” “ Morrel , ” muttered Albert— “ Morrel—who is he ? ” But before he had finished , M. de Château-Renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , —that is , with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemart , —took Albert ’ s hand . <EOS>	127.48450469970703

“ You will , I trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you , ” he said , “ but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people. ” “ So much so , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count. ” “ Upon my word , monsieur , ” said Danglars with affected carelessness , “ I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions ; but the fact is , I was made baron , and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor , in return for services rendered , but—— ” “ But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette ? <EOS>	144.02157592773438

And yet it is very hard , ” added she , “ that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend , treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies. ” “ That is because your fancies go too far , ” replied the triumphant Bonacieux , “ and I mistrust them. ” “ Well , I will give it up , then , ” said the young woman , sighing . <EOS>	90.32770538330078

But he stopped , doubtless to reflect ; for instead of allowing his first impulse , which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter , to carry him away , he leisurely descended the staircase , left the palace with his head down , mounted his horse , which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu , and with his eyes fixed on the gate , waited until the queen ’ s carriage had left the court . <EOS>	87.97541809082031

“ Yes , yes , ” replied he , “ I perceive that plainly ; but do you really believe it is she ? ” “ I am sure of it. ” “ Nevertheless , I confess I still doubt. ” “ But the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder ? ” “ She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France , and has been branded in consequence. ” “ Athos , she is your wife , I tell you , ” repeated D ’ Artagnan ; “ only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other. ” “ Yes ; but I should think the other must be dead , I hanged her so effectually. ” It was D ’ Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn . <EOS>	55.0673942565918

Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity . <EOS>	283.4129333496094
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth , who am neglected and forgotten by my father , harassed and persecuted by my stepmother , and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man , whose withered hand can no longer press mine , and who can speak to me with the eye alone , although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild . <EOS>	315.8368225097656

IN FRANCE The first fear of the King of England , Charles I. , on learning of the death of the duke , was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais ; he tried , says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_ , to conceal it from them as long as possible , closing all the ports of his kingdom , and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone , taking upon himself , in default of Buckingham , to superintend the departure . <EOS>	226.1259307861328

The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear , since the people had nothing more just then to ask for . <EOS>	127.61033630371094

He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field . <EOS>	163.30648803710938
“ Now I am alone , my dear Athos , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ open the door , I beg of you. ” “ Instantly , ” said Athos . <EOS>	16.91911506652832
“ There are several branches of the D ’ Artagnans at Tarbes and in its environs , ” said the cardinal ; “ to which do you belong ? ” “ I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry , the father of his gracious Majesty. ” “ That is well . <EOS>	163.07997131347656
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him , and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss . <EOS>	138.1560516357422
He then went straight to the door and knocked , murmuring , “ I will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap , but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse ! ” The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased , steps approached , the door was opened , and D ’ Artagnan , sword in hand , rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux , the door of which , doubtless acted upon by a spring , closed after him . <EOS>	108.91616821289062
This was Julie , who had become , as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted , Madame Emmanuel Herbault . <EOS>	131.4253387451172

Now , as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time , each becoming , naturally , more firm in his own opinion , M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly . <EOS>	273.38702392578125
Please follow me , ” and he went on before , followed by Athos and Aramis . <EOS>	77.9932861328125
It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . <EOS>	78.06546783447266
On opening the door , Villefort found himself facing him , and the young magistrate ’ s first impulse was to pause . <EOS>	123.41553497314453
Then they were both silent . <EOS>	93.82254791259766
“ A thousand pardons , gentlemen ; but no doubt this man brings me the news I expected. ” And rising also , he went off at a quick pace . <EOS>	126.65494537353516
Ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my images , three francs each . <EOS>	180.4458465576172
She had profited by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for Paris , and had reclaimed it . <EOS>	130.41409301757812
Well , sir , you ought to know that we no longer have a police , since we are no longer at Paris. ” “ I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are , but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections. ” “ But , God forgive me ! ” cried Anne , with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her , “ I believe that you are yourself interrogating. ” “ Yes , madame , here I have a right to do so , for it concerns Monsieur d ’ Artagnan—-d ’ Artagnan , ” he repeated , in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman . <EOS>	89.99348449707031
The prince read as he hastened on . <EOS>	179.51922607421875
Ah , that would indeed be infamous. ” “ How did Danglars usually write ? ” “ In a handsome , running hand. ” “ And how was the anonymous letter written ? ” “ Backhanded. ” Again the abbé smiled . <EOS>	157.37904357910156
“ I then swore that this woman who had ruined him , who was more than his accomplice , since she had urged him to the crime , should at least share his punishment . <EOS>	111.01689910888672

“ My lord , you are right , and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last . <EOS>	31.243507385253906
“ Oh , those Villeforts are an accursed race ! ” “ Truly they are , ” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone . <EOS>	112.07194519042969
“ But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , his eyes aflame , “ battle ! <EOS>	50.226356506347656
“ I entreat you—— ” continued Villefort . <EOS>	102.97794342041016
One thing , however , reassured him ; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off , and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders . <EOS>	87.50411987304688
“ Friend , ” said he , “ for Athos this is too much ; for the Comte de la Fère it is too little . <EOS>	39.69040298461914
That he has given the diamond to us only ? ” inquired Caderousse , half bewildered with joy ; “ yes , nothing more true ! <EOS>	85.95767211914062
“ Oh , madame , I do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times I am your most respectful servant. ” The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes . <EOS>	96.58284759521484
“ Decidedly , Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , you are the man I have been seeking . <EOS>	35.100433349609375
They advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again . <EOS>	102.70459747314453
“ Yes , you were thinking of it , and with justice . <EOS>	54.24221420288086

Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons ; Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands , Athos with his sword in his scabbard , his pistol in his saddle-bags ; calm and cool as if on the parade , except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes . <EOS>	185.9615936279297

At length Providence has done something for you ; he restores to you more than he takes away , and it was time I should die. ” Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim , “ Oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! ” and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , “ Oh , I have saved you once , and I will save you a second time ! ” And raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor . <EOS>	74.77346801757812

“ Sir , ” interposed Blaisois , “ I warn you that I can only swim in rivers. ” “ And I not at all , ” said Mousqueton . <EOS>	35.23719024658203
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche . <EOS>	285.8154602050781
“ Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation. ” “ Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and I have noticed that—— ” “ What ? ” “ That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform. ” “ You have evidently seen and observed everything. ” “ Let us proceed. ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Now as regards the second question. ” “ I am listening. ” “ Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès ? ” “ Yes ; a young man who loved her. ” “ And his name was—— ” “ Fernand. ” “ That is a Spanish name , I think ? ” “ He was a Catalan. ” “ You imagine him capable of writing the letter ? ” “ Oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me. ” “ That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character ; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never. ” “ Besides , ” said Dantès , “ the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him. ” “ You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? ” “ To no one. ” “ Not even to your mistress ? ” “ No , not even to my betrothed. ” “ Then it is Danglars. ” “ I feel quite sure of it now. ” “ Wait a little . <EOS>	116.30294799804688
He now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , dishevelled hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes , —someone by whose side he might weep . <EOS>	191.02279663085938
Cloud sounded half past ten . <EOS>	1151.73583984375
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment ; then , as if appearing to have formed a resolution , she said , “ I have an enemy. ” “ You , madame ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , affecting surprise ; “ is that possible , my God ? —good and beautiful as you are ! ” “ A mortal enemy. ” “ Indeed ! ” “ An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death . <EOS>	76.89318084716797
But he had scarcely left before Danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24 exclaimed : “ Fool ! ” Then enclosing Monte Cristo ’ s receipt in a little pocket-book , he added : — “ Yes , come at twelve o ’ clock ; I shall then be far away. ” Then he double-locked his door , emptied all his drawers , collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes , burned several papers , left others exposed to view , and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed : “ To Madame la Baronne Danglars. ” “ I will place it on her table myself tonight , ” he murmured . <EOS>	274.03021240234375
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress , and always thickly veiled ; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot . <EOS>	215.31781005859375

Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures , united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love , had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another , and economizing their stores , and Albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance : “ Mother , we have no more money. ” 50141m Mercédès had never known misery ; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those synonymous words , there is a wide difference . <EOS>	436.6354675292969
“ Certainly ; his panegyric has been uttered. ” They parted , laughing , she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest , he looking after her with eyes of love . <EOS>	317.8140563964844
This smile appeared to D ’ Artagnan to be of bad augury . <EOS>	94.76351165771484
“ Maximilian , Maximilian , ” he said , “ the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian. ” “ Oh , do not fear , my friend , ” said Morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count ; “ I shall no longer attempt my life. ” “ Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair ? ” “ No ; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife. ” “ Poor fellow , what is it ? ” “ My grief will kill me of itself. ” “ My friend , ” said Monte Cristo , with an expression of melancholy equal to his own , “ listen to me . <EOS>	42.179107666015625

Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger , the queen , when his death was announced to her , would not believe the fact , and even imprudently exclaimed , “ it is false ; he has just written to me ! ” But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence ; Laporte , detained in England , as everyone else had been , by the orders of Charles I. , arrived , and was the bearer of the duke ’ s dying gift to the queen . <EOS>	94.13287353515625

One day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of firearms , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks , and hurried towards them . <EOS>	126.07138061523438

“ Was not your father a Bonapartist ? ” asked Monte Cristo ; “ I think I remember that you told me something of that kind. ” “ My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else , ” said Villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; “ and the senator ’ s robe , which Napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him . <EOS>	85.82228088378906

“ Athos , my friend ! ” And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other ’ s arms ; then Athos , looking into his friend ’ s face and taking him by both hands , said : “ What ails you , my lord ? <EOS>	58.525455474853516

He felt a slight disappointment , however , when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton , and when Porthos signified to him that the state of his household , though great , would not support two servants , and that he must enter into the service of D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	85.02529907226562
But this time , instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse , and advanced to meet D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	64.58111572265625
A kind of steward appeared , just as D ’ Artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount . <EOS>	83.58190155029297
Besides—do you see that door , Athos ? ” “ Yes ; what then ? ” “ Well , you can go out by that door whenever you please ; for from this moment you are free as the air. ” “ I recognize you there , my brave D ’ Artagnan , ” replied Athos ; “ but you are no longer our masters . <EOS>	45.47536849975586
“ It is very hot , ” said Athos , drawing his sword in its turn , “ and yet I can not take off my doublet ; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed again , and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself. ” “ That is true , Monsieur , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , “ and whether drawn by myself or another , I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman . <EOS>	76.5788345336914

“ Well , ” cried his auditors ; “ at the moment you left his house ? ” Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort , like a man who , in the full relation of a falsehood , finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle ; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him , their ears were wide open , and there were no means of retreat . <EOS>	92.07632446289062

“ Count , ” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance , “ there is a beautiful Arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof. ” “ I know it , madame , ” replied the count ; “ but we are in France , and not in Arabia , and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another. ” “ But , ” said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , “ we are friends , are we not ? ” The count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson ; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled . <EOS>	123.55644226074219

Bonacieux ; “ therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others—that is quite another thing. ” “ Very well , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine. ” “ Beware of what you do ! ” cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make D ’ Artagnan start in spite of himself . <EOS>	56.151573181152344

“ But if it is a woman who writes , ” said Aramis , “ and that woman desires not to be seen , remember , you compromise her , D ’ Artagnan ; which is not the part of a gentleman. ” “ We will remain in the background , ” said Porthos , “ and he will advance alone. ” “ Yes ; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop. ” “ Bah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ they will miss me ; if they fire we will ride after the carriage , and exterminate those who may be in it . <EOS>	58.13616943359375

Do you think it is worth while ? ” said Villefort . <EOS>	37.89470672607422
That was a noble example to follow , monsieur. ” “ Why , ” replied Danglars , “ not entirely so ; with the servants , —you understand. ” “ I see ; to your domestics you are ‘ my lord , ’ the journalists style you ‘ monsieur , ’ while your constituents call you ‘ citizen. ’ These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government . <EOS>	264.1857604980469
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal ’ s death as a deliverance ; and I , even I , opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand . <EOS>	170.8319549560547
“ Ah , Danglars ! ” whispered Caderousse , “ you have deceived me—the trick you spoke of last night has been played ; but I can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault . <EOS>	131.79649353027344
’ Twas too brief an enjoyment , and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health ( of which it was perhaps rather the result ) would not long survive such a mode of life . <EOS>	209.2423095703125
“ Not a step forward , or you ’ re dead men. ” “ Stuff ! ” cried Porthos , almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit . <EOS>	244.38339233398438

He took his army to the priest ’ s , where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months , and to the cornet ’ s , who performed wonders ; but as Planchet said , “ People do not eat at once for all time , even when they eat a good deal. ” D ’ Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest ’ s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which Athos , Porthos , and Aramis had procured him . <EOS>	227.12399291992188
In this garden Mercédès had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously . <EOS>	182.48150634765625

Come , I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold. ” Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around ; indeed , Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid , or uttering a word . <EOS>	90.44139862060547
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation . <EOS>	104.87289428710938
I only ask you a simple question ; answer it ; —that is all I require. ” “ I love a young girl , count. ” “ Do you love her much ? ” “ More than my life. ” “ Another hope defeated ! ” said the count . <EOS>	78.08995819091797

Where are your passports ? ” “ We have none ; we left England , ignorant of the state of politics here , having left Paris before the departure of the king. ” “ Ah ! ” said the sergeant , with a cunning smile , “ you are Mazarinists , who are sent as spies. ” “ My dear friend , ” here Athos spoke , “ rest assured , if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport . <EOS>	87.40312194824219
“ Let us speak of my affairs , ” said Mazarin , “ since you will tell me naught of yours . <EOS>	39.71799850463867

The host insisted ; but the travelers were firm , and he was obliged to do as they wished . <EOS>	76.73736572265625
When he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , pried open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the phial contained , perhaps , twice as much more . <EOS>	186.09776306152344
Franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him ( Franz ) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so . <EOS>	207.7246856689453
Meantime , Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke . <EOS>	260.759765625
“ How long a start have they ? ” “ Two hours and a quarter , my officer. ” “ Two hours and a quarter—that is nothing ; we are well mounted , are we not , Porthos ? ” Porthos breathed a sigh ; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses . <EOS>	148.33441162109375
Well , I take you with me ; we conceal ourselves , and wait together. ” “ But I shall not be allowed to go ; I am almost a prisoner. ” “ As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal , no one will believe you anxious to follow me. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well ! <EOS>	45.98540496826172
The cardinal was , as we have said , in very low spirits ; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others . <EOS>	122.35746002197266
The count ’ s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man . <EOS>	120.42435455322266
( “ He were a dead man ” said the Gascon , “ if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment ; but for my part , before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once ; the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me. ” “ Hush ! ” said Porthos ; “ listen. ” ) “ Madame , ” cried the cardinal , seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back , “ Madame , what are you about ? ” Then he added in Spanish , “ Anne , are you mad ? <EOS>	97.95866394042969
“ No , thank you. ” “ Do you wish anything ? ” “ Leave me to pray. ” The count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel , who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees , and turned towards Paris , without once looking back . <EOS>	84.47577667236328
No , I feel that I have reached the goal , and I will go no farther . <EOS>	50.25026321411133

“ We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand , —a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter. ” “ Oh , ” cried Julie , “ I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand , as I now kiss the purse which he has touched . <EOS>	175.88046264648438

“ I feared it , Maximilian , ” said she ; “ it is the counsel of a madman , and I should be more mad than you , did I not stop you at once with the word ‘ Impossible , Morrel , impossible ! ’ ” “ You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it ? ” said Morrel sorrowfully . <EOS>	75.20735931396484
But you remind me . <EOS>	96.62481689453125
The men I have put to flight will return reinforced ; if they find us here , we are lost . <EOS>	185.49168395996094
Well , my friend , nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow. ” “ Hush ! ” said Athos , putting a finger on his lips , with the sad smile peculiar to him ; “ let us talk no more of Mordaunt—it will bring bad luck. ” And Athos set forward toward Charenton , followed closely by Aramis . <EOS>	138.4093780517578
“ She is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress. ” Noirtier again closed his left eye . <EOS>	119.89328002929688
Shall I send the father to you ? ” “ Immediately. ” “ Very well. ” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars ’ contempt , Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker ’ s wife should exercise in providing for the future . <EOS>	133.77696228027344
D ’ Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it . <EOS>	42.3991584777832

They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin , who paid them numerous compliments , and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired , namely , D ’ Artagnan his captaincy , Porthos his barony . <EOS>	174.525146484375
Wasn ’ t I right to part with the horses ? ” Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt . <EOS>	198.38389587402344
He looked around him and saw Mme . <EOS>	58.52598571777344
The lady was surpassingly beautiful , while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her . <EOS>	380.03912353515625
“ Now we are alone , dear Aramis , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchet ’ s horse. ” “ I ’ faith ! ” answered Aramis , “ as you see , from Heaven. ” “ From Heaven , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , shaking his head ; “ you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there. ” “ My friend , ” said Aramis , with a look of imbecility on his face which D ’ Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers , “ if I did not come from Heaven , at least I was leaving Paradise , which is almost the same. ” “ Here , then , is a puzzle for the learned , ” observed D ’ Artagnan , “ until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise ; some place it on Mount Ararat , others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates ; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it , while it was actually very near . <EOS>	72.56668090820312

Four marble steps led down to the water ’ s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide . <EOS>	203.07546997070312
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists ; there were landscapes by Dupré , with their long reeds and tall trees , their lowing oxen and marvellous skies ; Delacroix ’ s Arabian cavaliers , with their long white burnouses , their shining belts , their damasked arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces ; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger , representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet ; there were paintings by Diaz , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his suns more brilliant than the sun ; designs by Decamp , as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa , but more poetic ; _pastels_ by Giraud and Müller , representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats ’ “ Travels in the East , ” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel , or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past . <EOS>	867.2596435546875
Now , then , what had I better do ? ” “ Return instantly . <EOS>	67.88505554199219
Not at all , prince , ” said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title , “ what have I done for you ? <EOS>	93.3094711303711
“ Well , I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars. ” “ I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head. ” “ What fortune has she ? ” “ But I tell you—— ” “ A million ? ” Andrea shrugged his shoulders . <EOS>	77.91622161865234
The guards asked permission of La Ramee , who gave it to them , but not till the evening , however ; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone . <EOS>	73.75331115722656
All fell to their knees . <EOS>	105.60912322998047

“ Oh , as for that , I ’ ll take you to a splendid place , ” said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse ’ s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him . <EOS>	92.542236328125
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast ; then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain , and drank it . <EOS>	485.6683044433594
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more , for he exclaimed eagerly : “ Go on , I know nothing , as yet ; when you have finished your story , God and I will judge. ” “ Oh , father , ” continued the executioner , without opening his eyes , as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object , “ it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river , that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me ; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy , as if the cutlass was still in its grasp , as if the water had the color of blood , and all the voices of nature—the whispering of the trees , the murmur of the wind , the lapping of the wave—united in a voice tearful , despairing , terrible , crying to me , ‘ Place for the justice of God ! ’ ” “ Delirium ! ” murmured the monk , shaking his head . <EOS>	135.70428466796875
Vampa took Cucumetto ’ s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto , while in her turn Teresa remained outside . <EOS>	148.56439208984375
But pardon me , are you free ? <EOS>	102.96360778808594
“ Now I think of it , you can do better , ” said Danglars . <EOS>	30.678945541381836
As he departed , Danglars approached , and said , — “ Well , it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo ? ” “ Yes , most satisfactory , my dear Danglars. ” “ Well , so much the better , ” said the supercargo ; “ for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty. ” “ Dantès has done his , ” replied the owner , “ and that is not saying much . <EOS>	58.37865447998047
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing-place , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions . <EOS>	211.00856018066406
On rising , he went to his window , which opened on a terrace , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest . <EOS>	127.78009796142578
I can not account for it , but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars. ” 30107m “ Ah , ” said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , “ that may be easily explained ; the Comtesse de Morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth ; that is natural enough. ” “ I do not know if that is her reason , ” said Albert , “ but one thing I do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable . <EOS>	97.26000213623047
Eh , gentlemen , let us reckon upon accidents ! <EOS>	146.01722717285156
With forty-five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years , and comfortably for four ; but before six months—you with your music , and I with my voice—we shall double our capital . <EOS>	572.5082397460938
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count ’ s pistol . <EOS>	225.85739135742188
So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone . <EOS>	71.22007751464844
M. de Tréville listened to the young man ’ s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair . <EOS>	87.73533630371094
She is young ; she is beautiful ; she possesses all earthly seductions . <EOS>	480.9941711425781
Come to us this evening and to-morrow we ’ ll return your visit. ” “ Capital ! <EOS>	176.83340454101562
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry . <EOS>	295.5437927246094
D ’ Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn , and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it . <EOS>	112.36592864990234
He jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant ’ s arms , and joined them . <EOS>	53.85162353515625
“ Now , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I ’ ve one last favor to ask of you , Monsieur de Comminges. ” “ At your service , sir. ” “ You will see the count again ? ” “ To-morrow morning. ” “ Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained ? ” “ You want the cardinal to come here ? ” “ No ; I know my place and am not so presumptuous . <EOS>	39.508140563964844
“ Then the diamond is safe ? ” said he , timidly . <EOS>	39.73199462890625
Mercédès read with terror the following lines : “ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès , second in command on board the _Pharaon_ , this day arrived from Smyrna , after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo , is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper , and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris . <EOS>	163.67227172851562
Now this was a Sunday , and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him . <EOS>	87.61003875732422
“ Good-evening , comrade , ” said D ’ Artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner . <EOS>	87.38195037841797
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , — “ To the Island of Elba ! ” The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo . <EOS>	197.466552734375
The mendicant hesitated at first , but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented , and walked on before Athos . <EOS>	96.88835144042969
He was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him ; this seemed a good augury . <EOS>	224.39166259765625
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man , wrapped in a large cloak . <EOS>	69.34630584716797
“ Yes—yes , ” said Caderousse ; “ but you were right to return as soon as possible , my boy. ” “ And why ? ” “ Because Mercédès is a very fine girl , and fine girls never lack followers ; she particularly has them by dozens. ” “ Really ? ” answered Edmond , with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness . <EOS>	113.74365234375
‘ All hands to the pumps ! ’ I shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in . <EOS>	311.3485107421875
The two brigands looked at each other for a moment—the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow . <EOS>	122.3340072631836
‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo , who is now , I believe , in Paris ? ’ “ ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo , my foster-father , has been in Normandy the last three days. ’ “ ‘ Who , then , has counselled you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief . <EOS>	80.4158935546875
“ You smile. ” “ Yes. ” “ Why do you do so ? ” “ I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own . <EOS>	75.8405990600586
He found D ’ Artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante-room . <EOS>	90.71263122558594
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son . <EOS>	161.63758850097656
The house may be suspected ; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d ’ Artagnan , for I can affirm , sire , if I can believe what he says , that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty , or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal. ” “ Was it not this D ’ Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day , in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Déchaussés ? ” asked the king , looking at the cardinal , who colored with vexation . <EOS>	105.60484313964844
She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English , who thereupon requested D ’ Artagnan ’ s permission to retire , excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away , and charging his sister to obtain his pardon . <EOS>	128.1187744140625
“ She is there , ” said he . <EOS>	14.772539138793945
“ One moment , yes , ” answered the queen . <EOS>	22.31737518310547
Nevertheless , knowing the weakness of her husband , and more particularly his cupidity , she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose . <EOS>	137.58297729492188
I have said what I have said. ” “ And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation , ” replied D ’ Artagnan , in a low voice , “ I beg you to follow me. ” “ And when ? ” asked the Guardsman , with the same jeering air . <EOS>	36.34285354614258
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other . <EOS>	95.27813720703125
“ Why is that gendarme there ? ” asked Andrea of himself . <EOS>	76.47502136230469
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed . <EOS>	1114.09814453125
my friend ! ” cried Athos , suddenly , “ where have you brought us ? <EOS>	35.89783477783203
You must have discovered a mine , or else become a stockbroker. ” “ So that , as you confess , you are jealous ? ” “ No , I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you ; but as I am not quite properly dressed , I chose my opportunity , that I might not compromise you. ” “ Yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! ” exclaimed Andrea ; “ you speak to me before my servant. ” “ How can I help that , my boy ? <EOS>	74.9419174194336
The assizes , also , were about to begin , and Villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse . <EOS>	143.22918701171875
A high wall , at the angle of which was the pavilion , ran along one side of this lane , and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers-by . <EOS>	145.14581298828125
D ’ Artagnan , who never turned his head , did not perceive it . <EOS>	24.53708839416504
“ Three , ” replied Aramis , smiling . <EOS>	24.89841651916504
to be sure , yes . <EOS>	49.06749725341797
M. Bonacieux was at his door . <EOS>	46.67162322998047
In an instant he was among the branches , and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion . <EOS>	113.72174835205078
What would the abbé please to have ? <EOS>	168.4713592529297
“ Ha , ha , ” said Château-Renaud , “ here come some friends of yours , viscount ! <EOS>	68.45455169677734
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment . <EOS>	109.14335632324219
“ Oh ! <EOS>	41.94855499267578
“ Ah , my dear friend ! ” he cried , “ what bad stabling for my horses here. ” “ Indeed ! ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ I am most unhappy to hear it , on account of those fine animals. ” “ And I , also—I was also wretchedly off , ” he answered , moving backward and forward as he spoke ; “ and had it not been for the hostess , ” he added , with his air of vulgar self-complacency , “ who is very agreeable and understands a joke , I should have got a lodging elsewhere. ” The pretty Madeleine , who had approached during this colloquy , stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos ’ s words , for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated . <EOS>	121.00613403320312
His brain was on fire , and life and energy returned . <EOS>	280.49761962890625
“ What a devil of a face you have , Porthos ! <EOS>	105.43673706054688
After this second part of his discourse , fixing his hawk ’ s eye upon poor Bonacieux , he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation . <EOS>	183.30625915527344
The chocolate was inoffensive , for M. de Villefort felt no effects . <EOS>	185.3898162841797
How D ’ Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw . <EOS>	243.51177978515625
D ’ Artagnan preferred the second means , and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired . <EOS>	121.26982116699219
As for Villefort , instead of sending to Paris , he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès , in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely , —that is , a second restoration . <EOS>	252.9564666748047
“ About half-past six. ” “ We will be with you at that time , ” said the major . <EOS>	45.73706817626953
“ If we release the prisoner thus , we shall never know the truth. ” “ Athos may always be found , ” replied Tréville , “ ready to answer , when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him . <EOS>	90.75780487060547
We have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord . <EOS>	294.3096008300781
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered , Cromwell did not move . <EOS>	159.04461669921875
By degrees , the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them , and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel . <EOS>	158.59190368652344
“ As to Porthos , that is certainly droll ; but I am not the less a giddy fool . <EOS>	125.03411102294922
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment . <EOS>	675.505615234375
“ Well , ” said Franz to him ; “ there is the beginning of an adventure. ” “ Laugh if you please—I really think so . <EOS>	85.76263427734375
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood. ” “ Did you see nothing there ? ” asked the count . <EOS>	50.38935852050781
A light yacht , chaste and elegant in its form , was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake , extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles , and from Tunis to Venice . <EOS>	531.5361328125
50211m “ Madame , ” said the count , “ it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness , but I offer you consolation ; will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend ? ” “ I am , indeed , most wretched , ” replied Mercédès . <EOS>	47.439517974853516
“ Run ! <EOS>	201.35459899902344
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground . <EOS>	416.7471923828125
Coquenard , they arose slowly from the table , folded their napkins more slowly still , bowed , and retired . <EOS>	211.9839630126953
Do you not remember him ? ” “ Yes ! ” said Dantès , and without relinquishing Mercédès ’ hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air . <EOS>	68.59770202636719
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair . <EOS>	59.61259078979492
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege , but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating , we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded , to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal . <EOS>	114.63865661621094
“ Certainly , ” continued Danglars , “ the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned . <EOS>	72.51499938964844
As to Athos , he remained unmoved . <EOS>	84.82718658447266
He had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School , and left it as sub-lieutenant of the 53rd of the line . <EOS>	466.90277099609375
All at once he raised his head ; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution ; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten , and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him , he shrilled it twice . <EOS>	148.75735473632812
“ You have deceived me ! ” said the cardinal , sternly . <EOS>	31.209951400756836
“ Will these be in your way ? ” he said to the executioner , raising his long locks ; “ if so , they can be tied up. ” Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman . <EOS>	126.80995178222656
Death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow . <EOS>	174.00364685058594
“ A prisoner has escaped from the Château d ’ If , and they are firing the alarm gun , ” replied Dantès . <EOS>	96.16503143310547
“ Wait , ” said Athos . <EOS>	13.671215057373047
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds . <EOS>	124.73457336425781
He then repaired to D ’ Artagnan , who , thanks to his four trusses of straw , was in the act of making up and tasting , by anticipation , the luxury of a bed so soft , so well stuffed at the head , so well covered at the foot , that it would have excited the envy of the king himself , if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own . <EOS>	100.06659698486328
“ Ah ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , who began to understand . <EOS>	12.39606761932373
Let us load the guns. ” The four Musketeers went to work ; and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready . <EOS>	184.49392700195312
yes—I should expect so ; besides , if they forget , I shall take the liberty of reminding them. ” “ The queen ’ s voice ! <EOS>	77.52498626708984
I was only speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just now. ” “ And with all this , how unassuming he is ! <EOS>	384.18572998046875
“ How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning ? ” “ All owing to your influence , ” replied Monte Cristo , smiling . <EOS>	60.90625762939453
The prince , Monsieur de Retz , the Duc de Beaufort , the Duc de Bouillon , are talking over public affairs . <EOS>	61.50510025024414
On this conviction I allow her to speculate , she having her bank and her stockbroker ; she speculated and lost . <EOS>	650.7369995117188
“ Good morning , Benedetto , ” said Bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice . <EOS>	71.8302230834961
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman. ” “ A gentleman ! ” exclaimed Athos . <EOS>	33.09983825683594
Milady was only a queen while among queens . <EOS>	305.40380859375
“ Who are you , then ? ” cried all the witnesses of this scene . <EOS>	36.76893615722656
He arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room , saw Haydée , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back . <EOS>	100.71969604492188
In a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed . <EOS>	551.8771362304688
“ Repeat it ! <EOS>	165.31361389160156
The Englishmen , convinced of these peaceful proceedings , sheathed their swords grumblingly . <EOS>	824.4208374023438
if this man should ever discover the names of the others , my master is lost. ” “ Haste ! <EOS>	68.50990295410156
“ You see , ” said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to Faria , “ that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you . <EOS>	90.47991943359375
“ I have brought her here , sir , and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte , who , till better advice comes , has bathed the foot in cold well-water. ” The guests now all took leave of Athos , excepting the old Duc de Barbe , who , as an old friend of the family of La Valliere , went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage . <EOS>	202.55921936035156
Save me ! —I will not harm you. ” “ Andrea , the murderer ! ” cried one of the ladies . <EOS>	79.3936767578125
“ You know the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux . <EOS>	171.85003662109375
The queen saving us , her friends ; nothing more moral . <EOS>	430.89752197265625
It appears the conquerors had something else to do. ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , we shall find their muskets , their cartridges , and their flasks ; and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls , we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire. ” “ Oh , Athos ! ” said Aramis , “ truly you are a great man. ” Porthos nodded in sign of agreement . <EOS>	106.09012603759766
Athos and D ’ Artagnan said nothing , but their silence seemed to imply consent . <EOS>	85.08811950683594
The next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again . <EOS>	53.258174896240234
Now , as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance , as one calls his other hand to aid the first , I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there ; for I had seen you , Aramis , with the king , and you , count , I knew would be under the scaffold , and for that reason I forgive you , ” he added , offering Athos his hand , “ for you must have suffered much . <EOS>	102.15648651123047
To horse , my friends , to horse ! ” And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Béthune . <EOS>	109.00318908691406
Well ? ” “ Having , then , a keeper like La Ramee , I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me , who would assist me in my flight. ” “ Come , come , ” said La Ramee , “ that ’ s not a bad idea. ” “ Capital , isn ’ t it ? <EOS>	56.58104705810547
“ Ah ! <EOS>	40.143672943115234
I know that you belong to the cardinal , but belong to me as well , and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune . <EOS>	45.831817626953125
Toxicology It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort ’ s for the purpose of returning the procureur ’ s visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion . <EOS>	58.44472122192383
You will take a biscuit with it , will you not ? ” “ Yes , I will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging. ” Monte Cristo rang ; Baptistin appeared . <EOS>	62.15581512451172
Laporte pointed to the child , who was asleep . <EOS>	64.3974380493164
Porthos came up behind , and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room . <EOS>	236.87648010253906
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . <EOS>	207.58645629882812
“ Scratches himself ? ” inquired the duke , “ what does your majesty mean ? ” “ Yes , indeed , my dear duke . <EOS>	35.84604263305664
Her face , as she looked at Athos , had taken on an expression that can not be described . <EOS>	68.54816436767578
He was discovered ; all hope of flight was gone . <EOS>	173.95269775390625
Do you not see how she suffers ? ” Haydée answered with a heartrending expression , “ Why should he understand this , my sister ? <EOS>	106.2531967163086
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , “ I thought so ! ” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground . <EOS>	160.45407104492188
“ Come in , my lord , ” said Philip in a low tone , “ and I will show you something droll. ” Morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall . <EOS>	108.070068359375
“ I shall want you this evening , ” he said “ Return in two hours. ” “ My lord , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ I have an appointment in two hours which I can not miss. ” “ Do not be uneasy , ” said Mazarin ; “ it is the same. ” “ Good ! ” thought D ’ Artagnan ; “ I fancied it was so. ” “ Return , then , at five o ’ clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you . <EOS>	29.29557991027832
When I think of you my heart beats fast , the blood burns in my veins , and I can hardly breathe ; but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor , this fervor and intensity of feeling , until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you . <EOS>	302.9975280761719

He pushed the door open and entered . <EOS>	111.78794860839844
“ Oh , ” said Aramis , “ I always try to be prepared ; and then I knew you were seeking me. ” “ From whom ? ” “ From Master Bazin , to be sure ; he took you for the devil , my dear fellow , and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers. ” “ Oh , monsieur ! ” said Bazin , clasping his hands supplicatingly . <EOS>	67.48938751220703
Without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay . <EOS>	144.89492797851562
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre , he turned to the left , galloped across the Carrousel , passed through the Rue Saint-Roch , and , issuing from the Rue de la Michodière , he arrived at M. Danglars ’ door just at the same time that Villefort ’ s landau , after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house . <EOS>	107.40591430664062
“ Question , then , my lord. ” “ Where did the army cross the Lys ? ” “ Between Saint-Venant and Aire. ” “ By whom is it commanded ? ” “ By Count de Fuonsaldagna , General Beck and the archduke. ” “ Of how many does it consist ? ” “ Eighteen thousand men and thirty-six cannon. ” “ And its aim is ? ” “ Lens. ” “ You see ; gentlemen ! ” said the prince , turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers . <EOS>	203.7236328125
“ Your treasure ? ” stammered Dantès . <EOS>	60.71525573730469
More than that , we shall have a tempest , or I don ’ t know what ’ s what. ’ You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon ; luckily the captain understood his business . <EOS>	242.57803344726562
Breathing that sea breeze , so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached , contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy , all the power of that army which she was to combat alone—she , a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared herself mentally to Judith , the terrible Jewess , when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots , horses , men , and arms , which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke . <EOS>	421.5752258300781
Unfortunately , as he advanced , his anger increased at every step ; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge , he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality , which he accompanied with a furious gesture . <EOS>	151.51393127441406
“ I shall be gone only a few moments. ” Villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace . <EOS>	187.53005981445312
After giving some directions to Ali , who stood in the lobby , the count took Albert ’ s arm . <EOS>	89.27816009521484
Madame de Villefort merely cried , “ Be still , Edward ! ” She then added , “ This young madcap is , however , very nearly right , and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is , in spite of all we can do to rouse her , of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit , which frequently injure the effect of her beauty . <EOS>	145.050537109375
Have you not heard that some one is coming here ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Well , that some one will open the doors. ” “ But , my dear fellow , if that some one recognizes us , if that some one cries out , we are lost ; for you don ’ t propose , I imagine , that I shall kill that man of the church . <EOS>	64.0333023071289
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves , whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles . <EOS>	861.6499633789062
we have a precious fellow here ! ” “ Monsieur Grimaud ! ” said the duke , “ for your sake I beg of you , never come within the reach of my fist ! ” “ Hush ! <EOS>	52.35858154296875
You have two unruly prisoners there , sir. ” “ Unruly , ” Comminges smiled ; “ you wish to terrify me , I suppose . <EOS>	139.05191040039062

His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter . <EOS>	109.05866241455078
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets , stuffs of the Levant , and cashmeres . <EOS>	328.8379821777344
“ Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them. ” “ Well , when Dantès was arrested , Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad . <EOS>	162.86517333984375
He wished to hasten their steps ; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own , and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend . <EOS>	57.9407844543457
_Ventre-saint-gris_ , Monsieur de Tréville , as the king my father would have said . <EOS>	56.861846923828125
The popular banker found that it answered better than count . <EOS>	593.7984619140625
The queen breathed more freely . <EOS>	208.0084686279297
In dying , I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron : ‘ _Eo rus_ , and all will be over. ’ But come , Franz , take courage , your wife is an heiress. ” “ Indeed , Beauchamp , you are unbearable . <EOS>	402.1737976074219
“ But , ” said Mazarin , “ you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen. ” “ The king and the queen are my king and queen , ” replied the musketeer , “ my life is theirs and I must give it for them . <EOS>	44.43701934814453
And all present , even including Cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man . <EOS>	145.1593780517578
Athos rose , and offering him his hand , “ Be welcome , my Lord , ” said he , “ you are one of us. ” “ I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth , ” said Lord de Winter . <EOS>	39.22819137573242
“ This communication , ” continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion , “ will , we are sure , meet with your approbation. ” The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more . <EOS>	184.45346069335938
And you will tell him I will publish the report of Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru , upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade . <EOS>	215.9846649169922
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him . <EOS>	57.789222717285156
I beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish , too Italian , or too Arabian . <EOS>	163.00051879882812
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell , for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility . <EOS>	209.8863525390625
“ My friends , ” said Parry , mounting the scaffold and standing beside them , “ would you work a little more quietly ? <EOS>	131.4119873046875
She fainted . <EOS>	241.0028839111328

It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot. ” “ Wait , ” said Caderousse , “ we shall see. ” He then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off Cavalcanti ’ s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself . <EOS>	92.53738403320312
There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps , amusing themselves with the following exercise , while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport . <EOS>	156.53131103515625
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned . <EOS>	357.79034423828125
The cardinal envied that composure , which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger ; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself , that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage . <EOS>	387.8321838378906
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin , who was running breathlessly . <EOS>	125.27371978759766
Besides , D ’ Artagnan has not told us his idea yet. ” And the Musketeer , with his usual coolness , reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast . <EOS>	95.78815460205078
“ You will not sign that order , my Lord ! ” said Felton , making a step toward the duke . <EOS>	48.51979446411133
“ You have asked for me ? ” said the Musketeer . <EOS>	23.176197052001953
Neither had any . <EOS>	274.0457458496094
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips , but rage in her heart . <EOS>	152.89134216308594
With such a _vade mecum_ D ’ Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes , to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait . <EOS>	1087.8863525390625
“ I did not expect to see you again , ” said he feebly , to Dantès . <EOS>	42.13593673706055
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny ; we ’ ll have a supper here under your direction. ” “ Hum ! ” said La Ramee . <EOS>	97.55294036865234
“ You may guess , finding the luck turned , that I again staked the diamond. ” “ The devil ! ” said D ’ Artagnan , becoming angry again . <EOS>	82.85810089111328
“ Yes , he is a terrible antagonist . <EOS>	63.97635269165039
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX There was in all this , as may have been observed , one personage concerned , of whom , notwithstanding his precarious position , we have appeared to take but very little notice . <EOS>	229.94210815429688
I did not observe it yesterday. ” “ It must be the fog rising from the river , ” said the king . <EOS>	52.47798156738281

Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond . <EOS>	142.3946533203125
“ Half a million , ” said he , “ magnificent ! ” “ Half a million , is it ? ” said the major . <EOS>	33.08835983276367
And I have the same sincerity to show you , if you wish , Monsieur d ’ Herblay ; I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me. ” “ Really , monsieur , you say strange things , ” said Aramis . <EOS>	51.259151458740234
During this time , in the kiosk at my father ’ s feet , were seated twenty Palikares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats . <EOS>	138.20059204101562
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person . <EOS>	180.83164978027344
Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d ’ Avrigny ’ s door . <EOS>	56.31159591674805
She wouldn ’ t believe me , saying that she knew Anne of Austria , who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb . <EOS>	166.1463165283203
Planchet , by way of dessert , would have liked to hear the conversation ; but the citizen declared to D ’ Artagnan that , what he had to say being important and confidential , he desired to be left alone with him . <EOS>	106.72364807128906
“ Just so. ” “ Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud ? ” The traveler made a sign of assent . <EOS>	60.07561111450195

Four men , disguised as workmen , were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich , where a vessel was waiting. ” “ And knowing all that , your honor remained here , far from the city , tranquil and inactive. ” “ Tranquil , yes , ” replied Cromwell . <EOS>	138.78489685058594

Valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every-day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body . <EOS>	244.0155487060547

When my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the Bourbons ; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountain , —theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result. ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ it is just as I thought ; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d ’ Épinay into personal contact . <EOS>	255.60858154296875

Aramis affected a laugh , to divert the attention of certain curious listeners , and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there , he proceeded to join him , throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room . <EOS>	150.45755004882812

I swear by— ” “ Don ’ t waste time in swearing , ” said D ’ Artagnan ; “ let us gallop , if our horses will consent. ” And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses ’ flanks , who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies . <EOS>	310.6346435546875
Did you see the president at the minister ’ s last night ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What did he say ? ” “ Something which will surprise you. ” “ Oh , make haste and tell me , then ; it is a long time since that has happened. ” “ Well , he told me that Benedetto , who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning , is really but a very commonplace , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death. ” “ Bah , ” said Beauchamp , “ he played the prince very well. ” “ Yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , Beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them ; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry. ” “ Then you never believed in the principality ? ” “ Yes.—in the principality , but not in the prince. ” “ Not so bad , ” said Beauchamp ; “ still , I assure you , he passed very well with many people ; I saw him at the ministers ’ houses. ” “ Ah , yes , ” said Château-Renaud . <EOS>	94.5476303100586
It would be , no doubt , _parbleu_ , if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance , of the horrors of the cardinal— ” “ Speak lower ! ” said Athos . <EOS>	113.89208984375
The count , dismissing his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind . <EOS>	144.0865478515625
A small door , close to the lodge of the _concierge_ , gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot . <EOS>	225.06536865234375
All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day ; Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends—poor atoms , lost in that raging whirlwind . <EOS>	391.3090515136719
The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness . <EOS>	219.83633422851562
if I may ask without indiscretion. ” “ Near here , ” replied De Comminges , smiling ; “ so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are. ” “ He is wandering about the environs of the castle , ” thought D ’ Artagnan . <EOS>	89.51380920410156
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing . <EOS>	434.356201171875
He went straight to the queen , and in an altered voice said , “ Why , madame , have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs , when you know it would give me so much gratification ? ” The queen cast a glance around her , and saw the cardinal behind , with a diabolical smile on his countenance . <EOS>	73.7918701171875
“ Bring hither that horse. ” Friquet heard perfectly , but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road . <EOS>	229.42189025878906

“ ‘ Thou hast done well ! ’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice ; ‘ embrace me , my son. ’ 20115m Carlini threw himself , sobbing like a child , into the arms of his mistress ’ s father . <EOS>	158.63470458984375

D ’ Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils , and believed them to be buttoned ; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened , and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators , but even the actors themselves , laughed like so many madmen . <EOS>	247.42628479003906

There is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys , large enough to hold all the world. ” “ Your valise is then empty ? ” asked Porthos , with simplicity . <EOS>	129.07351684570312
Do you know about that institution ? ” “ I have heard of it. ” “ It is a magnificent charity. ” Having said this , the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies . <EOS>	94.10594177246094
At daybreak D ’ Artagnan entered the chamber , and demanded what was to be done . <EOS>	46.035274505615234
But we have not done with the thing yet. ” 0087m “ Do you , indeed , think so ? ” inquired the marquise . <EOS>	89.7816162109375
“ Look , ” said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , “ here is in this cup some syrup of violets , and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook . <EOS>	143.47418212890625

He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale , turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Milady ’ s apartment , which was to be seen through the blinds . <EOS>	92.14026641845703

At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal . <EOS>	73.49604797363281
“ Did the people shout at all ? ” Cromwell asked . <EOS>	114.27462768554688
By eight o ’ clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos . <EOS>	19.071903228759766
“ From that time he received all who came ; he had an excuse for not eating any more ; the doctor had put him on a diet. ” The abbé uttered a kind of groan . <EOS>	156.9188690185547
“ Take care , you are going to immure a traveller , Sinbad the Sailor , a man who comes to see Paris ; you are going to make a patriarch of him. ” 20255m “ Oh , no , ” said Morrel ; “ my sister is five-and-twenty , my brother-in-law is thirty , they are gay , young , and happy . <EOS>	94.72050476074219
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated Cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me. ” 0233m “ The physician may be mistaken ! ” exclaimed Dantès . <EOS>	279.3394470214844
Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history ; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner , and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep. ” Then , the count added aloud , “ Was his name ever known ? ” “ Oh , yes ; but only as No . <EOS>	203.65020751953125
He has taken part against his queen , or rather , against her minister . <EOS>	161.7421417236328
Give your orders , and we will execute them. ” “ Then open the door directly. ” Peppino obeyed . <EOS>	118.40938568115234
The third attack will either carry me off , or leave me paralyzed for life. ” “ No , no , ” cried Dantès ; “ you are mistaken—you will not die ! <EOS>	128.9132843017578
“ He gave no other name , ” answered Julie , looking earnestly at the count , “ than that at the end of his letter— ‘ Sinbad the Sailor. ’ ” “ Which is evidently not his real name , but a fictitious one. ” Then , noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice : “ Tell me , ” continued he , “ was he not about my height , perhaps a little taller , with his chin imprisoned , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely buttoned up , and constantly taking out his pencil ? ” “ Oh , do you then know him ? ” cried Julie , whose eyes sparkled with joy . <EOS>	105.24575805664062

He knew that it was barren and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to plunge into its waves again , and swim to Lemaire , equally arid , but larger , and consequently better adapted for concealment . <EOS>	382.1716613769531

Anticipating your wishes , I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages , and Ali , he whom you think so very ugly , ” continued he , addressing the boy with a smiling air , “ will have the honor of driving you home , while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash . <EOS>	150.0918731689453

Morrel reddened , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him . <EOS>	104.92395782470703
“ I believe so , ” replied Aramis . <EOS>	19.82523536682129
“ For two reasons. ” “ What ones ? ” “ The first is that my mistress will never love you. ” “ How do you know that ? ” “ You have cut her to the heart. ” “ I ? <EOS>	44.45097351074219
“ Ah , ah ! ” cried one of the Guards , “ will you persist in saying , most discreet Aramis , that you are not on good terms with Madame de Bois-Tracy , when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs ? ” Aramis darted at D ’ Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy . <EOS>	114.49596405029297
“ _Pardieu ! _ ” “ And what do they say of it in the world ? ” “ In which world ? <EOS>	42.4387321472168
“ Because he left no Commentaries , ” replied La Ramee , with his coarse laugh . <EOS>	92.64815521240234
Aramis then reperused the letter , and perceived a postscript : PS . <EOS>	801.4058837890625
“ Tell her grace , ” replied Athos , “ that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes. ” Then , with renewed instructions to Grimaud , Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment . <EOS>	117.98853302001953
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given , D ’ Artagnan put his horse into a gallop , and in a few strides overtook the carriage ; but the window was hermetically closed , the vision had disappeared . <EOS>	121.82772827148438
“ I should be delighted to do so , ” was the reply ; “ but if I am not mistaken , the words ‘ In haste , ’ are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought. ” “ You are right , ” said Du Tremblay . <EOS>	62.82908248901367
‘ Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees , ’ said I ; ‘ confess how you obtained this animal. ’ Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said , and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity . <EOS>	376.29779052734375

Bonacieux had also reflected ; but , it must be admitted , upon something widely different from ambition . <EOS>	313.52557373046875
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars , who had advanced to meet him . <EOS>	96.55655670166016
“ No , my friend , ” replied Athos , in his gentle but decided voice , “ we came here to defend King Charles ; we have but ill defended him—it remains for us to save him ! ” “ To save the king ? ” said D ’ Artagnan , looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos . <EOS>	56.32069778442383
Now promise me to remember this , and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon. ” “ Capital ! ” exclaimed Albert ; “ your breakfast shall be waiting. ” “ Where do you live ? ” “ No . <EOS>	62.9387092590332
As a result she raised her head , opened her eyes , and sighed deeply . <EOS>	91.85315704345703
D ’ Artagnan flew to his hole , laid himself down on the floor at full length , and listened . <EOS>	72.00951385498047
“ Olivain ! ” he exclaimed , “ what do I see below there ? ” A second scream , more piercing than the first , now sounded . <EOS>	89.7720718383789
Then he came back to the point where , perhaps , he ought to have begun , and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned ; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession , no one answered , and some of the neighbors , who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise , had assured him that that house , all the openings of which were tightly closed , had not been inhabited for six months . <EOS>	133.0505828857422
All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct. ’ “ ‘ Monsieur , ’ I replied , ‘ it is not for myself that I entreat your interference—I should grieve for him or avenge him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would perish from want , for my brother ’ s pay alone kept her . <EOS>	191.130859375
You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them , can act with energy—— ” “ Such was Cardinal Richelieu ’ s opinion , my lord. ” “ The cardinal , ” interrupted Mazarin , “ was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me . <EOS>	159.39462280273438

The general remark is , ‘ Oh , it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters . <EOS>	300.5111389160156
“ And now you are assembled , gentlemen , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ permit me to offer you my apologies. ” At this word _apologies_ , a cloud passed over the brow of Athos , a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos , and a negative sign was the reply of Aramis . <EOS>	99.98160552978516
Am I deceived ? <EOS>	368.8787841796875
“ What are you doing ? ” “ You have wounded me to the heart. ” “ Never mind it , for I see you once more , ” said the old man ; “ and now it ’ s all over—everything is all right again. ” 0035m “ Yes , here I am , ” said the young man , “ with a promising future and a little money . <EOS>	53.56139373779297

And the Greek princess , —will she be here ? ” “ No , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count ’ s establishment is not sufficiently understood. ” “ Wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to Madame de Villefort , who is trying to attract your attention. ” Albert bowed to Madame Danglars , and advanced towards Madame de Villefort , whose lips opened as he approached . <EOS>	74.64849853515625
In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness . <EOS>	811.6289672851562

Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himself—an intervention which had saved them from despair . <EOS>	716.5107421875
A Musketeer loves women , and he loves them by clasping his arms round them. ” Milady waited , then , with much impatience , for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton again . <EOS>	238.51666259765625

“ We are alone , sir , ” said Buckingham ; “ speak ! ” “ My Lord , ” said Felton , “ the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson. ” “ Yes , sir ; and I answered him , to bring or send me that order and I would sign it. ” “ Here it is , my Lord. ” “ Give it to me , ” said the duke . <EOS>	49.97566604614258
“ Arrived in London , you will seek Buckingham. ” “ I must beg your Eminence to observe , ” said Milady , “ that since the affair of the diamond studs , about which the duke always suspected me , his Grace distrusts me. ” “ Well , this time , ” said the cardinal , “ it is not necessary to steal his confidence , but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator. ” “ Frankly and loyally , ” repeated Milady , with an unspeakable expression of duplicity . <EOS>	102.2796630859375

D ’ Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many ; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position , like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him . <EOS>	126.72483825683594

Thinking of all this , and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse , D ’ Artagnan completed his short journey , and arrived at St. Germain . <EOS>	120.70807647705078

The friendship which united these four men , and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day , whether for dueling , business , or pleasure , caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows ; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another , from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice , or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg . <EOS>	215.3241729736328

An hour had passed since the sun had set , when Franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . <EOS>	177.27833557128906

The papers said something about it , did they not ? ” “ Then you believe the papers ? ” “ I ? —not the least in the world ; only I fancied that the honest _Messager_ was an exception to the rule , and that it only announced telegraphic despatches. ” “ Well , that ’ s what puzzles me , ” replied Danglars ; “ the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph. ” “ So that , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month. ” “ Not nearly , indeed ; that is exactly my loss. ” “ _Diable ! _ ” said Monte Cristo compassionately , “ it is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune. ” “ Third-rate , ” said Danglars , rather humble , “ what do you mean by that ? ” “ Certainly , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ I make three assortments in fortune—first-rate , second-rate , and third-rate fortunes . <EOS>	111.23150634765625

Being no disciple of Cagliostro , I was wholly unable to do this ; so , by way of getting out of the scrape , I said , ‘ Ask Morcerf ; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers ’ ends ; ’ whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you. ” “ Is it not almost incredible , ” said Madame Danglars , “ that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command , should possess so little information ? ” “ Let me assure you , madame , ” said Lucien , “ that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal , I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo , whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob . <EOS>	174.76748657226562

“ Stop , ” said he ; “ I will go with you. ” “ Excuse me , sir , ” said Franz , “ since M.

He was rather too pale , certainly ; but then , you know , paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding. ” Franz smiled ; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion . <EOS>	330.9876708984375

During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state , Valentine ’ s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man ’ s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted . <EOS>	232.94354248046875
Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile : “ Poor wretch , for half a crown he would do as much to his own father. ” The king was not mistaken . <EOS>	96.8565673828125

Thus Bassompierre , who was at once Protestant and Catholic—Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost ; Bassompierre , who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart—in short , Bassompierre , who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle , said , in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself , “ You will see , gentlemen , that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle. ” And Bassompierre was right . <EOS>	281.3484802246094

What is your name , in your turn , if you please ? ” “ D ’ Artagnan. ” “ To yours , monsieur. ” “ And above all others , ” cried D ’ Artagnan , as if carried away by his enthusiasm , “ to that of the king and the cardinal. ” The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of D ’ Artagnan if the wine had been bad ; but the wine was good , and he was convinced . <EOS>	51.10493469238281
He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard , and followed him , crying , “ Turn , turn , Master Joker , lest I strike you behind ! ” “ Strike me ! ” said the other , turning on his heels , and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt . <EOS>	140.79336547851562

“ Touch nothing , my little friend , ” cried the count eagerly ; “ some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste , but even to inhale. ” Madame de Villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son ’ s arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count . <EOS>	113.27076721191406

“ I am twenty-one years old , or rather I shall be in a few days , as I was born the night of the 27th of September , 1817. ” M. de Villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date . <EOS>	103.9749755859375

“ I understand the nature of your alarms , madame , ” said the count , carefully examining the child , “ but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least injury ; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass. ” “ Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears ? <EOS>	104.35345458984375
From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more , not even the length of time he had been imprisoned . <EOS>	218.61837768554688

“ Who is this young person , M. de Morcerf ? ” inquired Eugénie ; “ does anybody know ? ” “ Mademoiselle , ” said Albert , replying to this direct appeal , “ I can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing—the young woman is a Greek. ” “ So I should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as well-informed as yourself. ” “ I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_ , ” replied Morcerf , “ but I am reluctantly obliged to confess , I have nothing further to communicate—yes , stay , I do know one thing more , namely , that she is a musician , for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count , I heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own. ” “ Then your count entertains visitors , does he ? ” asked Madame Danglars . <EOS>	121.82122802734375
I hope that you will sometimes , too , think of me , and if at certain hours you should miss me , if you should feel any slight regret at my absence , I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself , and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you. ” After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed ; he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him , whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper , a mute and touching caress , which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter . <EOS>	147.17172241210938
During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army , and made a fortune ; then with that money he speculated in the funds , and trebled or quadrupled his capital ; and , having first married his banker ’ s daughter , who left him a widower , he has married a second time , a widow , a Madame de Nargonne , daughter of M. de Servieux , the king ’ s chamberlain , who is in high favor at court . <EOS>	180.26620483398438

Do you think he would recollect you ? ” “ My faith , monsieur , he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me. ” “ Well , go and talk with the boy , ” said D ’ Artagnan , “ and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead. ” Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin , who did not at all remember him , and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible ; while D ’ Artagnan turned the two horses into a lane , went round the house , and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts . <EOS>	74.17466735839844

The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest . <EOS>	77.48728942871094
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness , only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes , like the effects of a fever ; his brow was more pale than it generally was ; his teeth were clenched , and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him . <EOS>	217.39361572265625
“ But , madame , ” replied the count , continuing the conversation , and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine , “ have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ? <EOS>	66.39545440673828
“ Swear , then , ” said Villefort , joining the hands of Morrel and d ’ Avrigny , “ swear that you will spare the honor of my house , and leave me to avenge my child. ” D ’ Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “ Yes , ” but Morrel , disengaging his hand , rushed to the bed , and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own , hurriedly left , uttering a long , deep groan of despair and anguish . <EOS>	80.64009857177734
What is become of them ? ” “ You are very generous , gentlemen of the Guards , ” said Athos , full of rancor , for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day . <EOS>	70.35731506347656
Then , turning to Ali , she directed him to bring coffee and pipes , and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her . <EOS>	126.43126678466797

I not only permit , I desire ; let them come in. ” The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince . <EOS>	137.07992553710938

“ Don ’ t laugh , my friend ! ” cried D ’ Artagnan ; “ for heaven ’ s sake , don ’ t laugh , for upon my soul , it ’ s no laughing matter ! ” And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror , that Athos eagerly seized his hand , crying , “ Are you wounded , my friend ? <EOS>	59.790714263916016
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution . <EOS>	124.08232879638672
It was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking ; a death without agony , a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine ’ s name and pressing your hand. ” “ Yes , you have guessed rightly , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that is what I intended. ” “ Thanks ; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart. ” “ Do you then regret nothing ? ” “ No , ” replied Morrel . <EOS>	72.61212921142578

May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it ? ” “ It has been in the family a very long while , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital . <EOS>	130.36390686035156

“ Adieu , Raoul , ” said the count ; “ adieu , my dearest boy ! ” “ Adieu , sir , adieu , my beloved protector. ” Athos waved his hand—he dared not trust himself to speak : and Raoul went away , his head uncovered . <EOS>	103.24551391601562
“ Do you , perchance , think I set any great store by life ? ” “ There is something horribly mysterious under all this , Athos ; this woman is one of the cardinal ’ s spies , I am sure of that. ” “ In that case , take care ! <EOS>	94.33552551269531
“ It is not your fault , my good Ali , ” said the count in the Arabic language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face— “ it is not your fault . <EOS>	143.1991424560547
But I do not mean , my friend that we were right in what we did . <EOS>	50.724910736083984
Oh , my lord ! ” continued the queen , without restraining her tears , “ it is better to fight as the king has done , and to die , as perhaps he will , than live in beggary like me. ” “ Courage , madame ! <EOS>	69.41680908203125

“ Really , Porthos , you are a gifted individual ! ” “ I have heard speak , ” said Porthos , “ of a certain Milo of Crotona , who performed wonderful feats , such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it—of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders , et cetera . <EOS>	304.79888916015625
It could no longer be doubted ; the family name was fully given . <EOS>	212.2068634033203

The stranger , whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom . <EOS>	141.7836456298828
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte . <EOS>	222.22402954101562
“ Undoubtedly , ” said Villefort , moderating the tones of his voice , “ a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which I was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground . <EOS>	213.43844604492188

But you , madame , so beautiful in reality , you , so pure in appearance , must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you thus. ” “ They have eyes , ” repeated Milady , with an accent of indescribable grief , “ but they see not ; ears have they , but they hear not. ” “ But , ” cried the young officer , “ speak , then , speak ! ” “ Confide my shame to you , ” cried Milady , with the blush of modesty upon her countenance , “ for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another—confide my shame to you , a man , and I a woman ? <EOS>	103.94052124023438
Our duty is fulfilled. ” “ Not yet. ” said Aramis ; “ we have still a word to say to these gentlemen. ” And turning to Chatillon : “ Sir , be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I can not say before the queen. ” Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out , stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor . <EOS>	91.10780334472656
